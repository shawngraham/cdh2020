## Welcome!

I don't know how you found this page, but if you did, more power to you.

Check your Carleton email account for a note from me about getting started in the class.

There are *no* zoom meetings in this class (*balloons, confetti, streamers fall from ceiling, much rejoicing, etc*).

There _is_ a discord server for a class social space and for video, audio chat & screensharing (which is useful when things go wrong and you want someone to look at what you're doing). You are under no obligation to use Discord, but if you do, the invite link is in that email I sent.

So welcome aboard; explore the site; get set up with all the bits and bobs you need.

Take your time, try things in small chunks, ask for help. **You don't have to do this alone!**
