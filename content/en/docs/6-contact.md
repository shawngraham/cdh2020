Dr. Graham can be found online at

shawn dot graham at carleton dot ca

or on Twitter at [@electricarchae](http://twitter.com/electricarchaeo).

He will be present in our Crafting Digital History discord server nearly every day.

He will keep 'student hours' in Discord on Wednesday afternoons, 1 - 3 ish. Drop by; his audio is on; he's happy to chat with you!

He might be on campus from time to time, but don't count on it.
