Dr. Graham can be found online at

shawn dot graham at carleton dot ca

or on Twitter at [@electricarchae](http://twitter.com/electricarchaeo).

He will be present in our Crafting Digital History discord server every day.

If we ever get out of quarantine, and you're in Ottawa, he often haunts the Library coffeeshop.
