### Outcomes

1. This course will enable you to analyze and assess historical documents, artifacts, and other primary sources through the lens of digital history methods, critically applied, and you will develop awareness of the ways digital tools change what it is possible to know about the past.
2. At the same time, this ability will enable you to analyze and assess critically digital tools and methods from a historical perspective.
3. Given that this is an online course, another outcome will be your ability to conduct such research independently. However, no one operates in a vacuum; digital historians collaborate to troubleshoot or develop technologies, and through open practices to data sharing and reuse, learn to build upon each others' work in a collaborative fashion.
4. Another outcome will be the ability to translate the results of digital methods into historical argument.
5. Digital work is often necessarily therefore a kind of public work, and a final outcome therefore will be a professionalized presence online.
