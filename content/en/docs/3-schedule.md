The six weeks of the course are divided into four parts. Each part involves completing to the best of your ability a series of exercises; you will document your progress in a log that you will keep online. **Log entries are required to be completed by midnight at the end of the relevant part.** Late work can be accepted *only* in consultation with Dr. Graham. Otherwise, late work will not be graded nor accepted. (A few minutes/hours after midnight is _not late_.)
