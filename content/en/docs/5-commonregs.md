{{< /notice >}}

### COPIES OF WRITTEN WORK SUBMITTED
Always retain for yourself a copy of all essays, term papers, written assignments or take-home tests submitted in your courses.

### PLAGIARISM
The University Senate defines plagiarism as “presenting, whether intentionally or not, the ideas, expression of ideas or work of others as one’s own.” This can include:
+ reproducing or paraphrasing portions of someone else’s published or unpublished material, regardless of the source, and presenting these as one’s own without proper citation or reference to the original source;
+ submitting a take home examination, essay, laboratory report or other assignment written, in whole or in part, by someone else;
+ using ideas or direct, verbatim quotations, or paraphrased material, concepts, or ideas without appropriate acknowledgment in any academic assignment;
+ using another’s data or research findings;
+ failing to acknowledge sources through the use of proper citations when using another’s works and/or failing to use quotation marks;
+ handing in "substantially the same piece of work for academic credit more than once without prior written permission of the course instructor in which the submission occurs."

Plagiarism is a serious offence which cannot be resolved directly with the course’s instructor. The Associate Dean of the Faculty conducts a rigorous investigation, including an interview with the student, when an instructor suspects a piece of work has been plagiarized. Penalties are not trivial. They can include a final grade of "F" for the course.

A note from Dr. Graham: I am **completely** ok with you collaborating with a peer in this class or elsewhere on any of the work you do in this class **provided** that you fully acknowledge who you worked with and that you indicate how you worked together, who did what, and so on. Digital history isn't done in a vacuum. Unacknowledge help however is not cool.

### COURSE SHARING WEBSITES and COPYRIGHT
To the degree that I am able, all original content on this course website is released under creative commons licensed. That means you may copy and share and reuse it, but you must attribute [under the following terms - click through.](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/).

### STATEMENT ON CLASS CONDUCT
The Carleton University Human Rights Policies and Procedures affirm that all members of the University community share a responsibility to:
+ promote equity and fairness,
+ respect and value diversity,
+ prevent discrimination and harassment, and
+ preserve the freedom of its members to carry out responsibly their scholarly work without threat of interference.

Carleton University Equity Services states that 'every member of the University community has a right to study, work and live in a safe environment free of discrimination or harassment'. [In May of 2001 Carleton University’s Senate and Board of Governors approved the Carleton University Human Rights Policies and Procedures. The establishment of these policies and procedures was the culmination of the efforts of the Presidential Advisory Committee on Human Rights and a Human Rights Implementation Committee.]

### GRADING SYSTEM
Letter grades assigned in this course will have the following percentage equivalents:

Grade
|-----|-----|----|----|
|A+ = 90-100 (12) | B = 73-76 (8) | C - = 60-62 (4) | F= 0-49 (0) – Failure: no academic credit |
|A = 85-89 (11) |	B - = 70-72 (7) | D+ = 57-59 (3) | | 	
| A - = 80-84 (10) |	C+ = 67-69 (6) |	D = 53-56 (2) | |
| B+ = 77-79 (9) | 	C = 63-66 (5) | 	D - = 50-52 (1) | | 	

The following additional final course grades may be assigned by instructors:
*DEF* 	Official deferral of final exam (see "Petitions to Defer")
*GNA* 	Grade not available. This is used when there is an allegation of an academic offence. The notation is replaced with the appropriate grade for the course as soon as it is available.
*IP*	 In Progress – a notation (IP) assigned to a course by a faculty member when: At the undergraduate level, an undergraduate thesis or course has not been completed by the end of the period of registration.
*WDN*	Withdrawn. No academic credit, no impact on the CGPA. WDN is a permanent notation that appears on the official transcript for students who withdraw after the full fee adjustment date in each term (noted in the Academic Year section of the Calendar each term). Students may withdraw on or before the last day of classes.

Standing in a course is determined by the course instructor subject to the approval of the Faculty Dean. This means that grades submitted by the instructor may be subject to revision. No grades are final until they have been approved by the Dean.

### WITHDRAWAL WITHOUT ACADEMIC PENALTY

**May 12, 2022** Last day for registration and course changes for early summer courses

**May 20, 2022**: Last day for a full fee adjustment when withdrawing from early summer and full summer courses (financial withdrawal). Withdrawals after this date will result in a permanent notation of WDN on the official transcript.

**June 17, 2022**: Last day for academic withdrawal.
