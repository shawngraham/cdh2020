There is no midterm. There is no final exam.

### Weekly Exercises
Each week, there are set exercises for you to attempt.

Weekly work must be completed by the end of the relevant week. Late work can be accepted only through arrangement with Dr. Graham; otherwise it will not be accepted nor graded.

**If you miss a week, or something comes up** let Dr. Graham know as soon as possible so that arrangements can be made. I want you to be successful; if something comes up we can adapt accordingly. If you do not let me know, then I cannot help you.

{{< notice warning "Warning!" >}}
Do not attempt to 'speedrun' this course (ie leaving all of the coursework for one massive push) at the last moment; the cycle of feedback and growth is a critical learning element. You cannot grow if you try this. If you submit all of your work at the very last moment, you cannot meet at least two of the learning objectives of the course.
{{< /notice >}}

I am **not** looking for 'correct' completion, or that you powered through x amount of them. I am, rather, looking for your evidence of thinking through the meaning of the **process**: what worked, what didn't, why, and what that might mean for you as a historian. I am looking for you to tie your process explicitly to the readings. I am looking to see if the conversations you have with me or your peers (or indeed elsewhere on the web or in other courses) are causing you to reflect on the what/why/how/ of what you do.

### Evidence

Therefore, I am looking for the following kinds of evidence (each [week](/week) will specify what needs to be done):

+ logs that keep track of what you actually _tried_
+ reflection on that _process_
+ engagement with the readings and materials and your classmates (which might be demonstrated many different ways)
+ evidence for your growth as a historian over this course

At the end of each week, you will provide to me through a form that can be found on each weekly page the links to your evidence for me to consider, by Sunday evening.

I will return feedback to you within two or three days. I will write you a note giving you my perspective on what you've done (using the lens of the learning outcomes), and offering advice. Your weekly work will be assessed as 'satisfactory' or 'unsatisfactory'.

This feedback will also be mapped against the learning outcomes, so that you know how you are progressing throughout the course.

### The Exit Ticket

You will produce an '[exit ticket](week/6-5/instructions/)' for me at the end of the course (open format) reflecting on where you started and where you've gotten to, and you will indicate how you feel you've done against the [learning outcomes](docs/2-learning-outcomes). The exit ticket is a summary assessment exercise that will pull all the different strings together into a strong cord. **Everyone's journey is different**. Digital methods are more a matter of practice and time than they are of aptitude.

{{< notice success "Important" >}} Your final grade isn't based on getting something 'correct'. It's based on your own assessment of your own journey.

 If you've never done digital work before, it might be that you never quite manage to get as many of the tech things working as you might've wanted: but you now know _what you didn't know before_. That's a win. You might be a computer science minor and the tech materials don't present you with much challenge: but figuring out how to tell the compelling story was very difficult for you _but you're better at it now_. Your 'exit ticket' will explain to me your particular context, and it will point to the evidence that demonstrates how you've moved along from where you were at the beginning to where you are now.

 If I agree with your assessment, then that is the grade you will receive. **When I have disagreed in previous courses** this has been, 9.5 times out of 10, to _raise_ the grade: y'all are too hard on yourselves. If I have disagreed and felt that you've overstated things - if you were the 0.5 out of 10 - we would talk and come to an agreement.

 The Exit Ticket should be submitted by the last day of the early summer term. If you should require more time, you need merely to let me know; no questions asked.

### Grading

Remembering the [learning outcomes](2-docs/learning-outcomes),

|Learning Outcome|A|B|C|D|eg. Joe Q Student|
|----------------|-|-|-|-|-|
|1. analytical ability|-|-|-|-|X|
|2. methodology|-|-|-|-|-|
|3. collaboration|-|-|-|-|X|
|4. argumentation|-|-|-|-|X|
|5. professionalization|-|-|-|-|-|

...5/5 would be an A, 4/5 would be a B, 3/5 would be a C, 2/5 a D.

{{< alert theme="info" >}}
In this example, based on my consideration of Joe Q Student's evidence and the feedback I'd written him over the six weeks, it seemed to me that he did what he needed to do (satisfactorily) for 3 out of the 5 outcomes and so earned a C. However, his exit ticket might bring him up.

### Percentage Breakdown

I am required by the University to provide a percentage breakdown.

Weekly work = 80%
Final Exit ticket = 20%

I reserve the right to adjust those percentages to take into account the particular circumstances of the student.
