## The Last Bit

The last bit of the course is the **Exit Ticket**.

## Listen

### Do

The format of the exit ticket is up to you. You craft a statement reflecting on where you started and where you’ve gotten to, and you will indicate how you feel you’ve done against the [learning outcomes](https://craftingdh.netlify.com/docs/2-learning-outcomes). You may, if you wish, indicate what you think your letter grade ought to be, and why.

Think about your journey, and where you started. How have you grown? What successes did you have? Did you have any **glorious failures**? Did you help others - or did someone else make a difference for you? How did week 6 pan out for you? Could you take what you've learned and apply it in another course - or do you still feel hesitant about certain aspects? Can you contrast what you now know about digital history with what you thought about the subject when you started out back in May? Was there a single moment when things crystalized for you? What else do you wish you'd gotten to try?

This does not need to be much more than a single page (or the equivalent in other formats; how you measure that is up to you).

### Submit work

You can submit the link to your work on [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc3iURU-J6usI6994Hm9MkBsIViOEbnoIyqtxhmhXbFW8raAw/viewform?usp=sf_link)

### Celebrate

This hasn't been - I'll wager - an easy journey for you. But it will pay you back. I promise. Thank you for joining me!
