### Do

The format of the exit ticket is up to you. You craft a statement reflecting on where you started and where you’ve gotten to, and you will indicate how you feel you’ve done against the [learning outcomes](https://craftingdh.netlify.com/docs/2-learning-outcomes). You may, if you wish, indicate what you think your letter grade ought to be, and why.

Think about your journey, and where you started. How have you grown? What successes did you have? Did you have any **glorious failures**? Did you help others - or did someone else make a difference for you? How did week 6 pan out for you? Could you take what you've learned and apply it in another course - or do you still feel hesitant about certain aspects? Can you contrast what you now know about digital history with what you thought about the subject when you started out back in May? Was there a single moment when things crystalized for you? What else do you wish you'd gotten to try?

This does not need to be much more than a single page (or the equivalent in other formats; how you measure that is up to you).

### Celebrate

This hasn't been - I'll wager - an easy journey for you. But it will pay you back. I promise. Thank you for joining me!

### Audio Transcription

[music intro]

It's the last day of class. Your exit ticket should be coming into me pretty soon, although we've got a few days grace. Of course, if there is any issue, just let me know and we'll figure something out.

But the exit ticket is really quite important. It's one of my favorite kinds of assignments. And I came across it in a book by Cathy Davidson on "The New Education", where she's discussing how the university, as we know it has come to be in, and she has ideas about where it might go. And what I like about at the exit ticket is that it's a way of upending the game of being a student, you know, the game.

Do an essay, write a midterm, a final exam. Barf it all out on the page, rinse, repeat.

Right, there's nothing transformative about that, there's nothing that really sticks with you. (Although that's an unpleasant mental image).

Regardless.

The exit ticket is meant to be about you, more than me. Right? The exit ticket is a kind of reflection. You _know_ whether or not this class has changed your approach to history. And this class was never about assessing whether you could write python code or not. Rather, it's been designed -all right, at least I have tried to design it- to challenge your habits of thought. To help you learn how to learn. And how to develop resilience in the face of fails of all kind, technical fails, what have you - you remember, the first week we talked about all the different potential kinds of fields you might encounter?

The exit ticket is your opportunity to frame your own learning, your own journey. It's your opportunity to set the terms for how the story of your time in this class gets told. Now, you might want to usefully, re-read the learning outcomes from the syllabus in the first place, and remind yourself of where I thought things were going, and that those learning outcomes can be a useful framework to hang your your reflection, your exit ticket on.

But.

It often happens, and it's always exciting when it does: You might have identified outcomes for yourself, that I never imagined. And if that's the case, I want to know about it. Tell me about that, tell me about the journey. The exit ticket is a useful moment for you to pause, and look at the person who came into this virtual space on May 4th, and the person who is leaving it now. You know, your exit ticket: It's a ticket to a deeper, richer engagement with history. And it is my ambition and wish and expectation that it is going to take you places.

So, thank you everybody, for all of your care and attention and hard work, these last 6 weeks.

Good luck, let me know how you get on.
