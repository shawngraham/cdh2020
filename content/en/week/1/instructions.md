### Goals for this week

- getting our Github accounts set up and making our first log entries
- getting Hypothes.is set up
- getting Zotero installed
+ learn how to describe what's gone wrong, and to figure out how to fix it
- explore our ignorance: what _is_ dighist?

### Listen

- intro podcast

### Read

These readings have two aims. One, to ground the fact of the digital in the physicality of the world; Two, to give you a sense of the potentials. Most are fairly short.

+ Read [the full thread](https://twitter.com/amaliasl/status/1245544256212807680) by Amalia Skarlatou Levi and explore links of interest; annotate anything interesting you find with Hypothes.is in our group keeping in mind what you've already heard/read. Share anything interesting you've found in our social space. A handy getting-started approach to annotation is to think of the three W's: the weird, the wonderful, the worrying. Also add anything you read or anything interesting you find to your Zotero library.

### Do

- Follow the instructions for [Setting Up Github](/week/2020-wk1/github), [Setting up Hypothesis](/week/2020-wk1/hypothesis), and [Setting up Zotero](/week/2020-wk1/zotero).
- Log your reflection in your appropriate github repository

{{< notice success "Important" >}} With tech work, if it doesn't come together in about 30 minutes, it won't come in an hour. So take a break. Close the laptop. Call somebody up for help. Find another pair of eyes to look at the problem. I don't want to hear that you labored heroically for 2 hours to do something. Jump into our social space and ask for advice.
{{< /notice >}}

### Reflect

Using Github, make your first reflection. Detail any issues you had with getting started, any parts that caused you difficulty. If you got any error messages while trying to get set up, copy those into your reflection; google them. Do you find any websites that help you? What kind of 'failures' might you have encountered this week?

Drawing on your annotations of what you've read (and/or your notes from what you've listened to), discuss your idea of what 'digital history' might be _prior_ to starting this course, and think through whether any of the materials we've seen this week confirm or upset those notions. What kinds of 'digital silences' did you encounter? What has excited you? Finally, where do you want to go, with digital history?
