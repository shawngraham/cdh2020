### Introduction

Github is a code sharing website often used by digital historians. 'Git' is a program that takes snapshots of the current state of a folder, and stores them in sequence, allowing you to revert your changes to an earlier state. It also allows you to create **branches**, or duplicates of your folder, so you can experiment. If you like the results of your work, you can **merge** that branch back into your original.

**Github therefore is a hub for sharing these git snapshots.**

A branch (a copy, a duplicate) of your work uploaded to Github could therefore be copied to say my account (a **fork**); then I might download to my machine to work on it (I've **pulled** it). Once I'm happy with my changes, I **commit** them (save them to the sequence of changes that Git tracks), and then I could **push** those changes to the **fork** in my account. I would then send you a **pull** notice, asking you to pull my changes back to your account; you could then decide whether or not to **merge**.

For our purposes, you will use Github mostly as a place to put your reflections or other pieces of work.

I might sometimes fork your work, pull it down onto my machine, make changes that I commit, push it back online, and ask you to pull the changes back. But that won't happen very often. It takes a while to get comfortable with this.

### Get your account

1. Got to [github.com](http://github.com) and sign up for an account. You don't have to use your real name. (Protip: You might want to set up an email just for signing up for things.)

---

2. Verify your account.

---

3. Select the free tier (nb: I will never require you to pay for any reading, or any software. If something wants you to pay, **stop** and ask for help).

---

4. Skip telling Github anything about yourself.

---

5. Do the verification email thing. Once you hit the verification link in your email, you'll be brought back to Github to make a new repository:

![new repo](/images/github/github-new-repo.png)

---

6. Give it a reasonable name; tick the 'initialize with a readme' box, and hit the green commit button:

![new repo settings](/images/github/github-new-repo-settings.png)

---

7. And on the final page, hit the 'dismiss' button in the 'Github Actions box'

![dismiss actions](/images/github/github-dismiss-actions.png)

Ta Da! You now have a github account, and you've created your first repository. **Going Forward** create a new repository for each week's work/reflection. You can create a new repository from the plus sign in the top right corner:

![another new repo](/images/github/new-repo.png)

**nb** Remember to tick off the 'initialize with a readme.md' file.

---

Once you've done that, you'll be at your Github user page:

### Setting up a 'repository' for your work

A 'repository' is just a folder that you've shared on Github. There are two ways to do this; the easy way and the more complex way. Luck you, you have _already_ done the easy way - you selected the `initialize with a readme`, and it's already present in your browser!

{{< alert theme="info" >}}
To create new repositories, just click on the `+` button on the top right of your Github page when you're logged in. You might want to go ahead now and create repositories for week 2 through to week 6. Remember to tick off the `initialize with a readme` box.
{{< /alert >}}

But if you didn't tick the initialize box, you've embarked on the more complex way. In the screenshot below, I created a new repository but I forgot to initialize it, and now I'm looking at this page:

![non-initialized git](/images/github/github-complex.png)

If this is you, do not despair.

#### When you've forgotten to initialize a new repo:

1. If you have a PC, [click on this link to download and install git](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
2. Make a new directory on your computer **with the same name as the repo you created above**. In my example, that would be `week-two`.
3. On a PC, right-click on the folder and select 'open a command prompt here'. On a Mac, go to System Preferences, select Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services. Look for 'New Terminal at Folder' and tick the box. Open your finder; find the folder you created, right-click and select 'open Terminal here'.
4. Do you see where, in your browser at github, it says `...or create a new repository on the command line`? Type in each line exactly as it is there (beginning with `echo`), hitting enter at the end of each line, in order. **If the command works, you'll just be presented with the next prompt.** The computer only ever responds when there is output to print - which often means only when there is an error message to report.

Ta da! You can now go to `github.com\<your-user-name>\your-repo` and you'll see it all there tickety boo.

### Making a new text file on Github

You can make a new text file by clicking on the 'create new file' button; **remember to always use .md as the file extension**. You can specify headers, links, images, bullets, blockquotes and so on by using [markdown conventions](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/.)

The two videos below might be a bit clearer on youtube itself.

### Uploading a file into Github

You can add new files from your computer by dragging and dropping them into the main repository. At the end of this video, I show you how to display the image in the text of the reflection.

### Going further

Github can also be used to run an entire website, generated from your text files. In fact, that's how I built this course website! The following three links are from my HIST4806a 2020 seminar on digital history and museums; they will walk you through how to use your Github account to serve up a professional scholarly website; you can use this scholarly website to host your reflections and course work, if you want. Follow these three pages in order:

1. [Building Your Own Scholarly Website](https://shawngraham.github.io/dhmuse/building-your-online-presence/)

2. [Customizing Your Scholarly Website](https://shawngraham.github.io/dhmuse/customizing-your-site/)

3. [Updating Your Scholarly Website](https://shawngraham.github.io/dhmuse/updating-your-devlogs/)
