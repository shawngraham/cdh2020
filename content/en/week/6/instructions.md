### Goals for this week

+ experience something of the cycle of digital history by trying some exploratory analysis with the tools/approaches you've learned

### Listen  

### Read

### Do

Remember back in week one, how I had you explore that twitter thread by Amalia Skarlatou Levi? This week, you'll be selecting one of those resources she shared (or, if none strike your fancy, something from the resources gathered [here](https://diaryindex.com/digitized-diaries/)) to do some exploratory digital history.

You will use at least three appropriate techniques from weeks 1 to 4 to identify and surface some interesting historical observations from those sources, and you will imagine the possible directions such research might take.

You will share your results using an appropriate technique you encountered in week 5. Other possibilities are ok too; just check with Dr. Graham first. Remember, you don't have a lot of time, so keep your ambitions in check: the perfect is the enemy of the good.

{{< notice success "Important" >}} With tech work, if it doesn't come together in about 30 minutes, it won't come in an hour. So take a break. Close the laptop. Call somebody up for help. Find another pair of eyes to look at the problem. I don't want to hear that you labored heroically for 2 hours to do something. Jump into our social space and ask for advice. Remember: it's not **how many** you do, it's **that you pushed yourself** that matters.

### Reflect

Digital history is a process of encountering a body of information that suggests a question or two to you and then cycling back to that body of information to better understand _the question_ (we haven't even got to an _answer_ yet!). In so doing, you'll discover that the information is messy, or in the not-quite-right format. 80% of our time, as digital historians, is just getting things into shape for us to begin our exploration!
