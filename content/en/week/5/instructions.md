## Telling the Compelling Story

Eventually, after many cycles of cleaning data, making exploratory visualizations, and rerunning your analyzes, you will arrive at a point where you have this **thing** that you want to communicate. Perhaps it's part of a larger story, and illuminates some aspect that was hitherto hidden. Perhaps it's the entire story. Perhaps it only sets up the questions for a deeper investigation. There will come a moment when you want to communicate and tell this compelling story.

_Communicating this story in text or pictures is not your only option._

As this website demonstrates, I sometimes make bad design choices. I'm not particularly good at podcasting (I use [anchor.fm](https://anchor.fm) on my phone to do the recording, in my basement with its terrible acoustics).

But have a listen to this:

[(Writeup here explaining what you just heard)](https://electricarchaeology.ca/2019/12/20/making-nerdstep-music-as-archaeological-enchantment-or-how-do-you-connect-with-people-who-lived-3000-years-ago/).

This week, you'll learn of a few different ways of communicating the telling story.

### Goals for this week

- an introduction to infographics, academic posters, layout and colour with Inkscape and Gimp
- webmapping
- sonification
- websites via github pages

### Listen  

### Read

Explore two or three of the entries from last year's [DH Awards](http://dhawards.org/dhawards2019/results/), under the 'Best DH Data Visualization', and the 'Best DH Public Engagement' winners, runners up, and nominees.

Explore some of the suggestions. Or, take a look at this piece by former Carleton U public history MA student, Cristina Woods:

+ [Songs of the Ottawa](http://songsoftheottawa.ca/)
+ 'The Ottawa River's History Re-told in Musical Notes' [https://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/the-ottawa-rivers-history-re-told-in-musical-notes/](https://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/the-ottawa-rivers-history-re-told-in-musical-notes/)

Or explore [The Digital Panopticon](https://www.digitalpanopticon.org/).

### Do

- When/if you run into trouble, take screenshots (google how to do that for your particular machine) and these can be uploaded into your repository as well. Indeed, you should also keep track of any files you create as part of your weekly work in your repo: these are evidence!

{{< notice success "Important" >}} With tech work, if it doesn't come together in about 30 minutes, it won't come in an hour. So take a break. Close the laptop. Call somebody up for help. Find another pair of eyes to look at the problem. I don't want to hear that you labored heroically for 2 hours to do something. Jump into our social space and ask for advice. Remember: it's not **how many** you do, it's **that you pushed yourself** that matters.
{{< /notice >}}

### Record and Reflect

1. As you did for the previous weeks, make another notes.md entry and put it in your repo for week 5.

2. In your journal.md for this week, think about what you found intriguing, compelling, and effective about the various sites and projects you explored this week. With regard to your own work, reflect on your design choices and the story you're trying to tell, or the interesting thing you've found. Critically evaluate the thing(s) you've made; perhaps show them to someone outside of this course and ask for their feedback. Did they understand the point you were trying to make? What was effective, for them, and what was confusing? 

What had an impact _on you_ and how you think of your own historian's craft?
