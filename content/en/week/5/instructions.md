### Read

I asked on twitter, (as you do),

{{< twitter_simple 1249782467978035200 >}}

Explore some of the suggestions. Or, take a look at this piece by former Carleton U public history MA student, Cristina Woods:

+ [Songs of the Ottawa](http://songsoftheottawa.ca/)
+ 'The Ottawa River's History Re-told in Musical Notes' [https://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/the-ottawa-rivers-history-re-told-in-musical-notes/](https://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/the-ottawa-rivers-history-re-told-in-musical-notes/)

Or explore [The Digital Panopticon](https://www.digitalpanopticon.org/).

### Do

- When/if you run into trouble, take screenshots (google how to do that for your particular machine) and these can be uploaded into your repository as well. Indeed, you should also keep track of any files you create as part of your weekly work in your repo: these are evidence!

{{< notice success "Important" >}} With tech work, if it doesn't come together in about 30 minutes, it won't come in an hour. So take a break. Close the laptop. Call somebody up for help. Find another pair of eyes to look at the problem. I don't want to hear that you labored heroically for 2 hours to do something. Jump into our social space and ask for advice. Remember: it's not **how many** you do, it's **that you pushed yourself** that matters.

2. In your journal.md for this week, think about
