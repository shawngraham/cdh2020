Something given. That's a nice way of thinking about it. Of course, much of the data that we are 'given' wasn't really given willingly. When we [topic model Martha Ballard's diary](http://www.cameronblevins.org/posts/topic-modeling-martha-ballards-diary/), did she give this to us? Of course, she couldn't have imagined what we might try to do to it. Other kinds of data - census data, for instance - were compelled: folks had to answer the questions, on pain of punishment. This is all to suggest that there is a moral dimension to what we do with big data in history. Johanna Drucker famously framed it as [data versus capta](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/1/000091/000091.html), or 'things captured.'

In the tutorials for this part of the course, we're thinking about some of the ways historical materials [find their ways online](https://twitter.com/natlibscot/status/1255478042207621126) (read the thread behind that link!), and we're learning some of the ways we can pull that information onto our own machines for our own research. Read these two pieces discussing the way the [Transcribe Bentham project](https://blogs.ucl.ac.uk/transcribe-bentham/) organized the digitization of Bentham's papers.

### Do

1. Continue on with the sequence of tutorials you began with - the [newcomer sequence](tutorials/1-basic-progression/#newcomer-sequence), the [standard sequence](tutorials/1-basic-progression/#standard-sequence), or the [going-further sequence](tutorials/1-basic-progression/#going-further-sequence).
2. Use the template provided in the part two folder in the repo to write your log and to write your reflection. [Use markdown conventions to indicate headings, emphasis, bullets, links, etc](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). The reflection prompt is below:

> The tutorials for part two of the course revolve around ways of getting data from the web and onto our own personal machines. Here are some prompts to think about in the context of that work, and the readings listed above.

> Who _pays_ for work to end up online? Who does the work? What are some of the ethical dimensions of doing this work? Does Carleton give you any resources for getting those materials onto your own machine in formats you can read? What are some of the barriers to accessing the resources that Carleton _does_ make available to you? Where do you fit into this digital history machine?

> What is the value of/for historians (regular historians) showing their work, as opposed to, or in contrast to, what digital historians have to do? Where is the scholarly value in showing your work - and contrast this with how you've written history to date.

{{< alert theme="info" >}}
The best reflections tie what you have read to the things that I have asked you to do. Even if those things didn't quite work the way they were supposed to. Tech stuff comes with practice and exposure, so I'm not too worried if you hit tech bumps. But I am concerned if it appears like you don't understand why or how these bumps might matter, or how it all connects.

### When You Get Stuck

There is no shame, there is no trick! **You will get stuck.** When you do, make a post in the help channel in Discord indicating what tutorial you're working on, the error message that you are receiving, share a screenshot, explain what you were trying to do. **There is no shame in asking for help**; I do not want to learn that you have been suffering in silence trying to figure things out on your own. People who ask for help learn faster and have a better experience in this class and generally do better. You may ask me privately for help in Discord; we can screenshare and voice-chat as needed.

I will be in Discord nearly every day, and always on Wednesday afternoons.

### Submit Your Work

Put any ephemera you create as you do the tutorials into the part two folder in your copy of the github repo I provided. (the 'hist3814a-starter'). Make sure your log and reflection are up to date. Submit the link to the part one folder in your version of the repo using [this form](https://forms.gle/mEqh72LLR5vCqknW6).
