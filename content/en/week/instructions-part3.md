### Do

1. Continue on with the sequence of tutorials you began with - the [newcomer sequence](tutorials/1-basic-progression/#newcomer-sequence), the [standard sequence](tutorials/1-basic-progression/#standard-sequence), or the [going-further sequence](tutorials/1-basic-progression/#going-further-sequence). Alternatively, you may switch sequences at this point if you so desire; just make sure to make a note of it in a relevant log. Make sure to complete your logs and upload them to your Github repository.
2. Use the template provided in the part three folder in the repo to write your log and to write your reflection. [Use markdown conventions to indicate headings, emphasis, bullets, links, etc](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). The reflection prompt is below:

> Think about how the various authors in the readings so far make the case for how digital history arguments are advanced. Think about the cycle of jumping from close to distant 'reads' or 'views' of your material, and the ways the stories emerge - or not. What is missing from historical argumentation in digital history? What is different about this process from what you have come to experience as historians in other classes? How do the particular affordances of digital work change what you might know - and how you might argue it? How much (or what) _a priori_ knowledge is a requirement for digital history arguments to make sense to a reader/viewer/user?

> Or, think about what you found intriguing, compelling, and effective about the various digital history sites and projects you have explored so far. Tie what you find/observe to your own work. With regard to your own work on the tutorials, reflect on your design choices and the story you're trying to tell, or the interesting thing you've found. Critically evaluate the thing(s) you've made; perhaps show them to someone outside of this course and ask for their feedback. Did they understand the point you were trying to make? What was effective, for them, and what was confusing?

{{< alert theme="info" >}}
The best reflections tie what you have read to the things that I have asked you to do. Even if those things didn't quite work the way they were supposed to. Tech stuff comes with practice and exposure, so I'm not too worried if you hit tech bumps. But I am concerned if it appears like you don't understand why or how these bumps might matter, or how it all connects.

### When You Get Stuck

There is no shame, there is no trick! **You will get stuck.** When you do, make a post in the help channel in Discord indicating what tutorial you're working on, the error message that you are receiving, share a screenshot, explain what you were trying to do. **There is no shame in asking for help**; I do not want to learn that you have been suffering in silence trying to figure things out on your own. People who ask for help learn faster and have a better experience in this class and generally do better. You may ask me privately for help in Discord; we can screenshare and voice-chat as needed.

I will be in Discord nearly every day, and always on Wednesday afternoons.

### Submit Your Work

Put any ephemera you create as you do the tutorials into the part three folder in your copy of the github repo I provided. (the 'hist3814a-starter'). Make sure your log and reflection are up to date. Submit the link to the part one folder in your version of the repo using [this form](https://forms.gle/mEqh72LLR5vCqknW6).
