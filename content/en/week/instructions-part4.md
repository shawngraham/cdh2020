## DH Exploration Exercise

Remember back in Part one, how I had you explore that twitter thread by Amalia Skarlatou Levi? In this final segment, you'll be selecting one of those resources she shared (or, if none strike your fancy, something from the resources gathered [here](https://diaryindex.com/digitized-diaries/), or from the list of [Ottawa Datasets](#ottawa-datasets) at the bottom of the page) to do some exploratory digital history.

Depending on your stream, draw on at least 3|4|5 different tutorials **from across parts 1,2,3 of the course** that you've worked through, to identify and communicate some interesting historical observations from the data you've selected. Do what analysis you can (I'm not looking for _completeness_; think of this as an artist's first sketch for a possible painting), and then imagine the possible directions such research might take, based on what you've encountered in this course so far.

You might usefully draw some lessons about framing that research from Matthew Lincoln's post about '[Confabulation In The Humanities](https://matthewlincoln.net/2015/03/21/confabulation-in-the-humanities.html)'

Evaluate what you could do in terms of your learning curve with digital history versus where you'd like it to go. (ie, I realize that it's not realistic for you to complete an entire work of digital history within the time available, but I want you to do as much as you can with what you've got.)

{{< alert theme="info" >}}
You _must_ situate your work within or with reference to some of the literature you've read for this course (and other literature as relevant). You are welcome to draw from/re-use any reflections or log files you may have already created, suitably edited.
{{< /alert >}}

Put the results of this exercise (any digital ephemera you might create) into a **new repo** in your github, called 'DH-Exploration-Exercise'. Have a log file for the nuts-and-bolts work; in a separate file communicate the results in an appropriate format; you can call it `results.md`.

An excellent example from a previous cohorot (but keep in mind the requirements were slightly different last time, and the students had a shorter time frame to work on it!) is this piece by [Chantal Brousseau](https://hist-digitized.netlify.app/post/2020-06-14-week-six/).

**When you get stuck** make a post in the help channel in Discord indicating what tutorial you're working on, the error message that you are receiving, share a screenshot, explain what you were trying to do. **There is no shame in asking for help**; I do not want to learn that you have been suffering in silence trying to figure things out on your own. People who ask for help learn faster and have a better experience in this class and generally do better. You may ask me privately for help in Discord; we can screenshare and voice-chat as needed.

I will be in Discord nearly every day, and always on Wednesday afternoons.

### Optional Extra: The Exit Ticket

{{< alert theme="info" >}}
This is not a requirement.
{{< /alert >}}

But it is an opportunity for you to contextualize your work in this short spring term, which you may wish to do if, for example, your circumstances have had an impact on your work.

There is no set format. For the Exit Ticket, you craft a statement reflecting on where you started and where you’ve gotten to, and you will indicate how you feel you’ve done against the [learning outcomes](https://craftingdh.netlify.com/docs/2-learning-outcomes). You will indicate what you think your letter grade ought to be, and why (link to supporting material if you have it).

Think about your journey, and where you started. How have you grown? What successes did you have? Did you have any **glorious failures**? Did you help others - or did someone else make a difference for you? How did the DH Exploration Exercise pan out for you? Could you take what you've learned and apply it in another course - or do you still feel hesitant about certain aspects? Can you contrast what you now know about digital history with what you thought about the subject when you started out back in May? Was there a single moment when things crystalized for you? What else do you wish you'd gotten to try?

Again, this is optional.

This does not need to be much more than a single page (or the equivalent in other formats; how you measure that is up to you). If you choose to do this, put it into a part four folder in your copy of the github repo I provided (the 'hist3814a-starter') and upload to your github account. **Send me an email to alert me to the existence of your exit ticket**.

### Submit work

You can submit the link to your Dh Exploration Exercise work on [this form](https://forms.gle/mEqh72LLR5vCqknW6).

### Celebrate

This hasn't been - I'll wager - an easy journey for you. But it will pay you back. I promise. Thank you for joining me! If you're interested in more digital approaches to the past, join me in the Fall for HIST3000 An Introduction to Digital Archaeology.
