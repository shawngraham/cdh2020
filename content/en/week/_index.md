For this iteration of the course, I have divided the course into 4 unequal parts.

+ Part 1: May 6 - 12
+ Part 2: May 13 - 23
+ Part 3: May 24 - June 6
+ Part 4: June 7 - June 18

Each part has readings and reflection prompts meant to contextualize the various tutorials/hands-on work that you will do. Work is due by the end of the last day for each portion of the course.
