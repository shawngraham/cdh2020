Something given. That's a nice way of thinking about it. Of course, much of the data that we are 'given' wasn't really given willingly. When we [topic model Martha Ballard's diary](http://www.cameronblevins.org/posts/topic-modeling-martha-ballards-diary/), did she give this to us? Of course, she couldn't have imagined what we might try to do to it. Other kinds of data - census data, for instance - were compelled: folks had to answer the questions, on pain of punishment. This is all to suggest that there is a moral dimension to what we do with big data in history. Johanna Drucker famously framed it as [data versus capta](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/1/000091/000091.html), or 'things captured.'

This week, we're thinking about some of the ways historical materials find their ways online, and we're learning some of the ways we can pull that information onto our own machines for our own research. Read these two pieces discussing the way the [Transcribe Bentham project](https://blogs.ucl.ac.uk/transcribe-bentham/) organized the digitization of Bentham's papers.

### Do

Try to work through as many of these exercises as you can. Don't worry too much if you get stuck: the point is to push yourself beyond your _current_ level of ability. You are not grade on _how many_ of these you do, but rather on how you push your development as a digital historian: and that journey looks different for each of you.

+ Download and install the [Sublime Text Editor](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
+ Install Conda
+ Download web materials with wget
+ Retrieve materials from the [Chronicling America](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/) API
+ Use OCR (Object Character Recognition) to turn images of text _into_ text

Bonus (for when you have time, energy, and inclination):
+ Download videos with youtube-dl
+ Transcribe audio from videos and other sources automatically

- When/if you run into trouble, take screenshots (google how to do that for your particular machine) and these can be uploaded into your repository as well. Indeed, you should also keep track of any files you create as part of your weekly work in your repo: these are evidence!

{{< notice success "Important" >}} With tech work, if it doesn't come together in about 30 minutes, it won't come in an hour. So take a break. Close the laptop. Call somebody up for help. Find another pair of eyes to look at the problem. I don't want to hear that you labored heroically for 2 hours to do something. Jump into our social space and ask for advice. Remember: it's not **how many** you do, it's **that you pushed yourself** that matters.

### Record and Reflect

1. As you did for week one, make another notes.md entry and put it in your repo for week 2.

2. In your journal.md for this week, think about, who _pays_ for work to end up online? Who does the work? What are some of the ethical dimensions of doing this work? Does Carleton give you any resources for getting those materials onto your own machine in formats you can read? What are some of the barriers to accessing the resources that Carleton _does_ make available to you? Where do you fit into this digital history machine? Put your journal.md into your github repo for week 2.

### Submit work

You can submit the link to your work on [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc3iURU-J6usI6994Hm9MkBsIViOEbnoIyqtxhmhXbFW8raAw/viewform?usp=sf_link)
