### Goals for this week

### Listen  

### Read

### Do

{{< notice success "Important" >}} With tech work, if it doesn't come together in about 30 minutes, it won't come in an hour. So take a break. Close the laptop. Call somebody up for help. Find another pair of eyes to look at the problem. I don't want to hear that you labored heroically for 2 hours to do something. Jump into our social space and ask for advice.
