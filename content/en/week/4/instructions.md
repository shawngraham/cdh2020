## Of Macroscopes and Microscopes

### Goals for this week

This week, I want you to begin to have a 'dialogue with your texts', wherein you learn to use three tools of varying levels of complexity to get distant and close reads on a body of information. Iterating through this cycle, will help you know your data better and see the patterns that would otherwise be lost in all the noise.

When you do this kind of work, it is super important that you make a note of what you expect to find _before_ you do the analysis; as Matthew Lincoln reminds us, we have to do this so that we don't post-facto rationalize what we find as something we already knew...

### Listen  

### Read

+ Arguing  with  Digital  History  working  group,  "Digital  History and Argument," white paper, Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media(November 13, 2017): [https://rrchnm.org/argument-white-paper/](https://rrchnm.org/argument-white-paper/).

+ Tim Hitchcock, 2013 ['Big Data for Dead People'](https://historyonics.blogspot.ca/2013/12/big-data-for-dead-people-digital.html) _Historyonics_

+ Matthew Lincoln, 2015 ['Confabulation in the humanities'](https://matthewlincoln.net/2015/03/21/confabulation-in-the-humanities.html) _blog_

### Do

- Begin with some Excel basics
- Load some data into Voyant-Tools and explore it
- Consider the power of collocation with AntConc
- See if a topic model might usefully surface some patterns.
- In this week's bonus, there's a web toy called 'Imj' for exploring patterns in _visual_ data.

- When/if you run into trouble, take screenshots (google how to do that for your particular machine) and these can be uploaded into your repository as well. Indeed, you should also keep track of any files you create as part of your weekly work in your repo: these are evidence!

{{< notice success "Important" >}} With tech work, if it doesn't come together in about 30 minutes, it won't come in an hour. So take a break. Close the laptop. Call somebody up for help. Find another pair of eyes to look at the problem. I don't want to hear that you labored heroically for 2 hours to do something. Jump into our social space and ask for advice. Remember: it's not **how many** you do, it's **that you pushed yourself** that matters.

### Record and Reflect
1. As you did in previous weeks, make another notes.md entry and put it in your repo for week 4.

2. In your journal.md for this week, think about
