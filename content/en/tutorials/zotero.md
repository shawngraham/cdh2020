Zotero is a piece of software for managing your research. When it is installed, it can extract metadata from websites or pdfs (when these have metadata) and store the information in your very own library. Zotero can be connected to Word or Google Docs so that when it is time to insert a reference, you can select the reference from your library - and then get the machine to automatically format/update your bibliography against whatever citation style you use.

**Nb** I am recommending that you install Zotero, and get in the habit of using it. As you progress through this course, add the things you read to Zotero - whether they are things that I have assigned to you or are things you encounter on your own. When you produce the final [Exit Ticket](week/6-5/instructions/) you might wish to refer back to some of what you've read; Zotero will save you time there!

You can [download Zotero here](https://www.zotero.org/download/). Note that you have to also install 'connectors' for your browser.
