## Introduction

Everyone comes to digital work with differing levels of prior familiarity with computing. You do not need to be 'techy' (whatever that is), but you do need to be open _to learning from things that fail_. This can uncomfortable.

{{< notice success "Important" >}}For all of the tutorials that you attempt, I require that you keep a log of your work. For this, you create a text file in which you keep your thoughts, the error messages, the solutions you try, the websites you go to for help, the advice you get from others, and so on. Take screenshots of error messages, google the error messages, put everything into your log.
{{< /notice >}}

You are allowed to collaborate (I strongly encourage it!). If/when you do (or you find 'outside' help) I merely require that you acknowledge it and reflect on how knowledge is crafted.

There are three different **sequences** of tutorials that you may attempt. There is a **newcomer** sequence for those individuals who feel some trepidation or hesitation about doing digital work. There is a **standard** sequence for folks who feel ok about the work but are open to pushing themselves. There is a **going further** sequence for those who are looking for more of a challenge. The sequence you choose does not affect your grade relative to someone else (there is no curve).

The logic of the sequences: Part 1 is about setting up your own personal digital history ecosystem. Part 2 is about finding data. Part 3 demonstrates a variety of ways of exploring/analysing/visualizing/communicating that data; for my money, there are three main strands of digital history - there are the macroscopic perspectives; there are the approaches that are more like public history in that they are focussed on communicating beyond the discipline; and there are map based approaches. Of course all of these smear into and across each other, but it might help you choose which ones to do given your own interests. Part 4 is an opportunity for you to plot out an engagement with digital history using what you've learned.

**It's not about completing exercises; I am interested in your PROCESS, which is why I want your logs.**

You may switch tracks **after** part 2 is over if you wish. You don't need to inform me nor ask for permission. Just make a note of it in the relevant log.

## Log & Reflection Due Dates

You will submit your logs by the end of the day on

+ May 13
+ May 24
+ June 6th
+ June 17th

Reflections that tie your response to the readings to the work you have completed are due at the same time, remember. You are welcome to submit at any time before those dates, of course.

## Log Requirements

Logs must be _complete_ and _truthful_. By 'complete', I mean: there is sufficient detail and information that a reasonable onlooker could replicate what you have done, what you are trying to do, and why. By 'truthful' I mean that I expect to see evidence of your actual process - screenshots, error messages, etc.

**You can ask anyone, at anytime, from anywhere, for technical help**. Acknowledge the help (eg, you're being 'truthful', right?)

{{< notice success "Important" >}} With tech work, if it doesn't come together in about 30 minutes, it won't come in an hour. So take a break. Close the laptop. Call somebody up for help. Find another pair of eyes to look at the problem. I don't want to hear that you laboured heroically for 2 hours to do something. Jump into our social space and ask for advice.

## NB: For all Sequences

I talk at various times and in various tutorials about using the command line or the terminal. If this confuses you or I am not clear, a former student (Chantal Brousseau) made two excellent walkthroughs **for when you need them** that I encourage you to take a look at, depending on your machine:

[Using the terminal/command line on a Mac](/tutorials/command-line-mac)

[Using the terminal/command line on a PC](/tutorials/command-line-win)
