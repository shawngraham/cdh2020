Ok folks - I'm making this video before course starts, so if there's anything that emerged over part 1 that we need to address, you'll find it in the relevant discord channel.

Part One was about giving you some of the background on digital history. If you read the Gaffield article, you'll see that digital history has been around in some form or another for decades. If you read the Martin article, you'll see that the ways we've taught (continue to teach!) digital history lead to some very poor outcomes. How much of that resonates with your own experience? I'm looking forward to reading your reflections; and of course, how y'all made out setting up your own personal digital history workbench on your machines.

Markdown future proofs your research; github keeps the evolution of your research under version control and enables collaboration; anaconda gives you access to a wide variety of tools and tool ecosystems for very nearly everything you might want to do with historical information (whether it's quantitative like censuses or textual like diaries or personal papers)

This part of the course is where things start to diverge for your own personal journey. For everyone, the concern is two-fold: getting information off the web, and starting to wrangle it into shape for asking questions. Notice that the act of wrangling necessarily presupposes that you have an idea of what questions you might be able to address - or what questions might emerge. And it's not necessarily a one-two-three step arrangement; it's more cyclical, more back-and-forth.

What I'm _not_ asking you to do is to do that first act of translation, of putting historical information on the web in the first place. No, you are the recipients of all kinds of scholarly generosity, hidden labour, and power relationships, for the comparatively easy access to the information you enjoy. The readings for this week explore some of the issues about getting info online in the first place, and the knotty issues that wrangling such data generate, the kinds of history that can result.

So, read the materials, start thinking about the reflection prompts, and decide which stream you'll explore. Ask each other for help. There is no shame in saying, 'I am stuck at trying to do x'. Indeed, _that's_ where the *actual* learning takes place! When something breaks, when something doesn't work, when it fails: make it a *glorious* failure by using your experience to help someone else.
