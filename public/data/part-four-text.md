- You've now had a taste of something of the cycle of doing digital work, of retrieving historical information that has been prepared for you on the web, of cleaning it into something that you can work with, to some exploratory analyses or visualizations or distant views using your digital macroscopes.
- every single one of those steps is frought with issues that affect the kind of history you can tell, the kinds of questions you can ask, the sorts of people you can see, the issues that you can address.
- just because we're using digital technologies doesn't mean that we achieve some kind of 'objectivity'. Digital tech _might_ mean that at least our work can be more open for inspection, query, and re-use: but only if we consciously choose to be open about what we've done, the choices we've made, the things we're aiming after.
- this goes against a lot of what you've been _disciplined_ into doing as new scholars.
- at the very least, whenever you encounter digital scholarship, you'll now have a sense of what is being left unsaid when you explore it. Part of what I've been trying to teach you has been inspired by the work of Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren F Klein, in their book 'Data Feminism'. If you take my introduction to digital archaeology class, we'll get more into their work. For now, the bits that most inspire how this class has been put together has been their injunction to make labor visible, and to think about your own relationship to the data as you work with it.
- the final part of this course is an exercise that will give you the opportunity to select some historical information, and to try your hand at adapting what you've done in the tutorials to this new information.
- this will require you to pay attention to things like how the data is made available to you, assumptions about the data in the original code or walkthroughs I had you do, and the appropriateness of a particular technique in the service of a particular question.
- it's entirely ok to take an 'exploratory' approach - what might I see if I try this, this, or that?
- I'm not expecting a fully complete digital history project. If this were a thirteen week course, then yes I would. We would share work in progress. We would help each other. We would teach each other new techniques that we've learned to solve particular questions or issues as they emerge.
- But this is a six week course. What I'm asking you to accomplish is more similar to an artist's first sketches at an idea, rather than the bloomin' sistine chapel, ok?
- I *do* want you to put whatever you do into conversation with things you've read for this course or encountered elsewhere in your degree progression. I'm expecting citations and a bibliography. I'm not fussed about citation style; in markdown, author-date is probably easiest, just an fyi.
- So explore some of the available collections of information I've made available to you. Plot out a plan; play. Save emphemera data, intervening steps, screenshots, outputs of all kinds, into your repo. Keep a log file as before. Instead of a reflection though, I want you to communicate the results of your exploration in a manner that is appropriate to the material. In years past, some folks have made a podcast episode. Others a website. Still others have created online exhibitions, or twine explorations, or academic posters made as a single powerpoint slide, exported to pdf.
- whatever you choose to do, I'm still looking for the same things I always look for.
- but what if it just doesn't come together? there is a genre in digital humanities around the idea that discussing things that don't work is a valuable exercise. Blog it; create a presentation; whatever. Even if the code or technique you chose doesn't come together how you wanted it to, *it is still a valuable thing to tell us about*!
- One of my first academic pieces was a blog post about how I had messed up the security settings on a crowd-sourcing history website I put together. Viagra bots killed the site, destroying my entire project.
- so... I am totally OK with discussions of tech failures. If that happens to you, I strongly recommend you look up Brian Croxall and Quinn Warnick's taxonomy of tech fails to structure your response, or Quinn Dombrowski's talk about the death of her Project Bamboo.
- you're just at the beginning of digital history; as long as you're open and honest about what you've done, and why, and you understand what's important about the work, well... that's all I can ask for and that's my hope for you.
- have fun!
