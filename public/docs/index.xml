        <description>HIST3814O|DIGH3814O Summer 2020 Department of History, Carleton University This is a methods course about learning to use the huge variety of digitized historical resources available in the world, including some perhaps unconventional sources such as social media. You will learn some of the habits of doing born-digital work, including the doing of digital history as an outward facing public history.
You do not need to be &amp;lsquo;techy&amp;rsquo; to be successful in this course!</description>

        <description>Outcomes  This course will enable you to analyze and assess historical documents, artifacts, and other primary sources through the lens of digital history methods, critically applied, and you will develop awareness of the ways digital tools change what it is possible to know about the past. At the same time, this ability will enable you to analyze and assess critically digital tools and methods from a historical perspective. Given that this is an online course, another outcome will be your ability to conduct such research independently.</description>

        <description>This course originally was a face-to-face class, over 13 weeks. That let us get into the nitty-gritty of different approaches and platforms; it gave us the opportunity to have guest speakers; and most importantly, it gave us the time to really grapple with different kinds of historical &amp;lsquo;capta&amp;rsquo; (see Drucker on &amp;lsquo;capta versus data&amp;rsquo;). But, needs evolved and eventually the course moved fully online. Now only 6 weeks long, a lot of things have been cut, compressed, or rethought entirely.</description>
