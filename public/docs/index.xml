        <description>Outcomes  This course will enable you to analyze and assess historical documents, artifacts, and other primary sources through the lens of digital history methods, critically applied, and you will develop awareness of the ways digital tools change what it is possible to know about the past. At the same time, this ability will enable you to analyze and assess critically digital tools and methods from a historical perspective. Given that this is an online course, another outcome will be your ability to conduct such research independently.</description>

Log entries are required to be completed by midnight at the end of the relevant part. Late work can be accepted only in consultation with Dr. Graham. Otherwise, late work will not be graded nor accepted.</description>

        <description>There is no midterm. There is no final exam. Repositories, logs, and reflections In each part of this course, there are things to read and reflect on, and things to do, depending on which sequence you choose to follow. Everyone&amp;rsquo;s journey is different. Digital methods are more a matter of practice and time than they are of aptitude.
You will collect all of your work together and keep track of it in an account you will create on Github.</description>

        <description>This course originally was a face-to-face class, over 13 weeks. That let us get into the nitty-gritty of different approaches and platforms; it gave us the opportunity to have guest speakers; and most importantly, it gave us the time to really grapple with different kinds of historical &amp;lsquo;capta&amp;rsquo; (see Drucker on &amp;lsquo;capta versus data&amp;rsquo;). But, needs evolved and eventually the course moved fully online. Now only 6 weeks long, a lot of things have been cut, compressed, or rethought entirely.</description>
