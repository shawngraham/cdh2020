If you spot someone asking for help and you can offer advice, respond to the annotation. Introduction Github is a code sharing website often used by digital historians. \u0026lsquo;Git\u0026rsquo; is a program that takes snapshots of the current state of a folder, and stores them in sequence, allowing you to revert your changes to an earlier state. It also allows you to create branches, or duplicates of your folder, so you can experiment. If you like the results of your work, you can merge that branch back into your original.\nGithub therefore is a hub for sharing these git snapshots.\nA branch (a copy, a duplicate) of your work uploaded to Github could therefore be copied to say my account (a fork); then I might download to my machine to work on it (I\u0026rsquo;ve pulled it). Once I\u0026rsquo;m happy with my changes, I commit them (save them to the sequence of changes that Git tracks), and then I could push those changes to the fork in my account. I would then send you a pull notice, asking you to pull my changes back to your account; you could then decide whether or not to merge.\nFor our purposes, you will use Github mostly as a place to put your reflections or other pieces of work. I might sometimes fork your work, pull it down onto my machine, make changes that I commit, push it back online, and ask you to pull the changes back. But that won\u0026rsquo;t happen very often. It takes a while to get comfortable with this.\nGet your account  Got to github.com and sign up for an account. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to use your real name. (Protip: You might want to set up an email just for signing up for things.)  Verify your account.  Select the free tier (nb: I will never require you to pay for any reading, or any software. If something wants you to pay, stop and ask for help).  Skip telling Github anything about yourself.  Do the verification email thing. Once you hit the verification link in your email, you\u0026rsquo;ll be brought back to Github to make a new repository:  Give it a reasonable name; tick the \u0026lsquo;initialize with a readme\u0026rsquo; box, and hit the green commit button:  And on the final page, hit the \u0026lsquo;dismiss\u0026rsquo; button in the \u0026lsquo;Github Actions box\u0026rsquo;  Ta Da! You now have a github account, and you\u0026rsquo;ve created your first repository. Going Forward create a new repository for each week\u0026rsquo;s work/reflection. You can create a new repository from the plus sign in the top right corner:\nnb Remember to tick off the \u0026lsquo;initialize with a readme.md\u0026rsquo; file.\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;ve done that, you\u0026rsquo;ll be at your Github user page:\nSetting up a \u0026lsquo;repository\u0026rsquo; for your work A \u0026lsquo;repository\u0026rsquo; is just a folder that you\u0026rsquo;ve shared on Github. There are two ways to do this; the easy way and the more complex way. Luck you, you have already done the easy way - you selected the initialize with a readme, and it\u0026rsquo;s already present in your browser!\nTo create new repositories, just click on the + button on the top right of your Github page when you\u0026rsquo;re logged in. You might want to go ahead now and create repositories for week 2 through to week 6. Remember to tick off the initialize with a readme box. But if you didn\u0026rsquo;t tick the initialize box, you\u0026rsquo;ve embarked on the more complex way. In the screenshot below, I created a new repository but I forgot to initialize it, and now I\u0026rsquo;m looking at this page:\nIf this is you, do not despair.\nWhen you\u0026rsquo;ve forgotten to initialize a new repo:  If you have a PC, click on this link to download and install git. Make a new directory on your computer with the same name as the repo you created above. In my example, that would be week-two. On a PC, right-click on the folder and select \u0026lsquo;open a command prompt here\u0026rsquo;. On a Mac, go to System Preferences, select Keyboard \u0026gt; Shortcuts \u0026gt; Services. Look for \u0026lsquo;New Terminal at Folder\u0026rsquo; and tick the box. Open your finder; find the folder you created, right-click and select \u0026lsquo;open Terminal here\u0026rsquo;. Do you see where, in your browser at github, it says ...or create a new repository on the command line? Type in each line exactly as it is there (beginning with echo), hitting enter at the end of each line, in order. If the command works, you\u0026rsquo;ll just be presented with the next prompt. The computer only ever responds when there is output to print - which often means only when there is an error message to report.  Ta da! You can now go to github.com\\\u0026lt;your-user-name\u0026gt;\\your-repo and you\u0026rsquo;ll see it all there tickety boo.\nMaking a new text file on Github You can make a new text file by clicking on the \u0026lsquo;create new file\u0026rsquo; button; remember to always use .md as the file extension. You can specify headers, links, images, bullets, blockquotes and so on by using markdown conventions\nThe two videos below might be a bit clearer on youtube itself.\n  Uploading a file into Github You can add new files from your computer by dragging and dropping them into the main repository. At the end of this video, I show you how to display the image in the text of the reflection.\n  Going further Github can also be used to run an entire website, generated from your text files. In fact, that\u0026rsquo;s how I built this course website! The following three links are from my HIST4806a 2020 seminar on digital history and museums; they will walk you through how to use your Github account to serve up a professional scholarly website; you can use this scholarly website to host your reflections and course work, if you want.

You will learn some of the habits of doing born-digital work, including the doing of digital history as an outward facing public history.\nYou do not need to be \u0026lsquo;techy\u0026rsquo; to be successful in this course! You just need to be diligent, honest, and open. You will read, watch, listen to, and discuss the class materials via various online tools including Hypothes.is and Github (Speaking of Hypothes.is, highlight a word on this page and see what happens). We do not use cuLearn in the course. We work on the open web instead. Successful completion of this class involves doing a series of exercises each week designed to push you out of your comfort zone, AND to be a collegial and generous scholar engaging with, and helping your peers to achieve success. What is challenging for one student will not necessarily be challenging for another, and I expect you to push yourself and pull others along as you go. Thus open and honest reporting of what works and what hasn’t worked, is a meaningful aspect of this course. You don’t need to be techy to succeed, but you do need to be willing to embrace when things go ‘wrong’.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s super important that you try to complete the weekly exercises each week before moving onwards. Each week builds on the previous week\u0026rsquo;s work. In my experience, trying to complete this course in a compressed time frame is extremely difficult. Stay on task, complete one module a week. Work that is completed by the end of the week can expect formative feedback from me by the middle of the subsequent week. I prioritize responding to recent work, rather than overdue work. There is no grade penalty for overdue work, but you will miss out on feedback.\nThis course aims to change how you think about, and think with, digitized resources and digital tools. I am not trying to turn you into a coder. Rather, I am trying to turn you into a historian who is thoughtful and reflective about the ways digital tools transform what it is we know about the past and how we come to know it.\n","description":"what to tell your friends","id":25,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"1. Course Description","uri":"https://craftingdh.netlify.com/docs/1-coursedescription/"},{"content":"Outcomes  This course will enable you to analyze and assess historical documents, artifacts, and other primary sources through the lens of digital history methods, critically applied, and you will develop awareness of the ways digital tools change what it is possible to know about the past. At the same time, this ability will enable you to analyze and assess critically digital tools and methods from a historical perspective. Given that this is an online course, another outcome will be your ability to conduct such research independently. However, no one operates in a vacuum; digital historians collaborate to troubleshoot or develop technologies, and through open practices to data sharing and reuse, learn to build upon each others\u0026rsquo; work in a collaborative fashion. Another outcome will be the ability to translate the results of digital methods into historical argument. Digital work is often necessarily therefore a kind of public work, and a final outcome therefore will be a professionalized presence online.  Texts See the weekly work section. All readings are open access.\nReal Names Policy You do not need to use your real name or identity on any public-facing work that you do in this course. Nor do you need to explain to me that you wish to use a pseudonym. It is sufficient that you send an email to me with the following message:\n‘I would like to use the following username in all public-facing work: xxxxxxxx’\n…where xxxxx is the name you have selected. For safety’s sake, if you decide to use a pseudonym, do not use one that you have used on any other website or social media platform.\nWhen Life Intervenes There\u0026rsquo;s nothing we can\u0026rsquo;t roll with, in this class. That said, it is a compressed time frame: so if something comes up, just let me know:\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t have to share the details with me. It is enough for me to know that something has intervened. I trust you.\r When something comes up and this course has to move to the backburner, contact me and we can figure out something else to do, or something else that will help you be successful here. It\u0026rsquo;s our course - we can change things up as we need to.\n","description":"what you'll get out of this course","id":26,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"2.

Course Calendar","uri":"https://craftingdh.netlify.com/docs/3-schedule/"},{"content":"There is no midterm. There is no final exam.\r Weekly Exercises Each week, there are set exercises for you to attempt.\nWeekly work should be completed by the end of the relevant week.\nI am not looking for \u0026lsquo;correct\u0026rsquo; completion, or that you powered through x amount of them. I am, rather, looking for your evidence of thinking through the meaning of the process: what worked, what didn\u0026rsquo;t, why, and what that might mean for you as a historian. I am looking for you to tie your process explicitly to the readings. I am looking to see if the conversations you have with me or your peers (or indeed elsewhere on the web or in other courses) are causing you to reflect on the what/why/how/ of what you do.\nEvidence Therefore, I am looking for the following kinds of evidence (each week will specify what needs to be done):\n logs that keep track of what you actually tried reflection on that process engagement with the materials and your classmates (which might be demonstrated many different ways) evidence for your growth as a historian over this course  At the end of each week, you will provide to me through a form that can be found on each weekly page the links to your evidence for me to consider, by Sunday evening.\nI will return feedback to you within two or three days. I will write you a note giving you my perspective on what you\u0026rsquo;ve done (using the lens of the learning outcomes), and offering advice. Your weekly work will be assessed as \u0026lsquo;satisfactory\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;unsatisfactory\u0026rsquo;.\nThis feedback will also be mapped against the learning outcomes, so that you know how you are progressing throughout the course.\nThe Exit Ticket You will produce an \u0026lsquo;exit ticket\u0026rsquo; for me at the end of the course (open format) reflecting on where you started and where you\u0026rsquo;ve gotten to, and you will indicate how you feel you\u0026rsquo;ve done against the learning outcomes. The exit ticket is a summary assessment exercise that will pull all the different strings together into a strong cord. Everyone\u0026rsquo;s journey is different. Digital methods are more a matter of practice and time than they are of aptitude.\nYour final grade isn\u0026rsquo;t based on getting something \u0026lsquo;correct\u0026rsquo;. It\u0026rsquo;s based on your own assessment of your own journey.\r If you\u0026rsquo;ve never done digital work before, it might be that you never quite manage to get as many of the tech things working as you might\u0026rsquo;ve wanted: but you now know what you didn\u0026rsquo;t know before. That\u0026rsquo;s a win. You might be a computer science minor and the tech materials don\u0026rsquo;t present you with much challenge: but figuring out how to tell the compelling story was very difficult for you but you\u0026rsquo;re better at it now. Your \u0026lsquo;exit ticket\u0026rsquo; will explain to me your particular context, and it will point to the evidence that demonstrates how you\u0026rsquo;ve moved along from where you were at the beginning to where you are now.\nIf I agree with your assessment, then that is the grade you will receive. When I have disagreed in previous courses this has been, 9.5 times out of 10, to raise the grade: y\u0026rsquo;all are too hard on yourselves. If I have disagreed and felt that you\u0026rsquo;ve overstated things - if you were the 0.5 out of 10 - we would talk and come to an agreement.\nThe Exit Ticket should be submitted by the last day of the early summer term. If you should require more time, you need merely to let me know; no questions asked.\nGrading Remembering the learning outcomes,\n   Learning Outcome A B C D eg. Joe Q Student     1. analytical ability - - - - X   2. methodology - - - - -   3. collaboration - - - - X   4. argumentation - - - - X   5. professionalization - - - - -    \u0026hellip;5/5 would be an A, 4/5 would be a B, 3/5 would be a C, 2/5 a D.\nIn this example, based on my consideration of Joe Q Student\u0026rsquo;s evidence and the feedback I\u0026rsquo;d written him over the six weeks, it seemed to me that he did what he needed to do (satisfactorily) for 3 out of the 5 outcomes and so earned a C.

The Associate Dean of the Faculty conducts a rigorous investigation, including an interview with the student, when an instructor suspects a piece of work has been plagiarized. Penalties are not trivial. They can include a final grade of \u0026ldquo;F\u0026rdquo; for the course.\nCOURSE SHARING WEBSITES and COPYRIGHT To the degree that I am able, all original content on this course website is released under creative commons licensed.

Contacting Dr. Graham","uri":"https://craftingdh.netlify.com/docs/6-contact/"},{"content":"This course originally was a face-to-face class, over 13 weeks. That let us get into the nitty-gritty of different approaches and platforms; it gave us the opportunity to have guest speakers; and most importantly, it gave us the time to really grapple with different kinds of historical \u0026lsquo;capta\u0026rsquo; (see Drucker on \u0026lsquo;capta versus data\u0026rsquo;). But, needs evolved and eventually the course moved fully online. Now only 6 weeks long, a lot of things have been cut, compressed, or rethought entirely. I do not aim for coverage. Rather, I am trying to help you learn the skills that you will need to uncover whatever aspect of digital history method and thought that will help you with your research goals. A big part of that is trying to teach how to deal with what might feel like \u0026lsquo;failure\u0026rsquo;, on first blush.\nSocial Contact Another problem with moving fully online was the isolation. Working with digital tools, especially when you\u0026rsquo;re not overly familiar with how they work - or even the underlying metaphors that would help you make sense of what\u0026rsquo;s going on - is frustrating. Bad enough when you have classmates you see twice a week and can at least complain with over coffee later; extremely awful when you\u0026rsquo;re on a bad internet connection and everyone thinks that you\u0026rsquo;re not really doing schoolwork.\nInitially, I used Slack as a way of trying to meet that need for human connection that makes learning meaningful. It worked, more or less, but if there was a conversation going on and you missed part of it, it could just feel overwhelming and impenetrable.\nAnd it was one more damned thing to install. One more damned thing to get a password for.\nI tried Zulipchat another year. Same problem again.\nThis year, as I write this, I\u0026rsquo;m trying Discord, for its voice and screensharing integration. We\u0026rsquo;ll see how that goes.\nThe Workbook I put all of the materials for the course into an online workbook, built from text files that used markdown conventions to indicate headings, links, images and so on. The website for the workbook would then be generated using mkdocs, a python library for generating static websites. It worked, but over the years I kept adding more and more to it, links would get broken or websites would go offline\u0026hellip; it was a lot of work to prune it, keep it up to date.\nAnd then COVID-19 happened.\nI normally have a lot of time to rethink what needs taught, to prune what has become useless, to add newer resources, newer thinking. But this time around, not so much. I put the older version of the course away, and started trying to build what I thought were the most useful elements: given everything else that is going on, what are the key things I think you ought to do in order to plant the seeds of your eventual engagement with digital history?\nThe result is this present website, which combines a number of features of the course that were previously spread across a number of locations. I have also pared down to a more limited number of skill-based exercises so that you have more time to think about the context (historiographical, theoretical) of their potential use. I offer more direction and less freedom-to-choose in terms of the work I think that needs to be done, but the trade off here is that you are more able to share what you are doing with your peers and to find help.\nWhich reminds me:\nDigital History is a team sport. You are never expected to power through all of this material on your own in heroic scholarly endeavor. If you need help, ask for help; if you can help, offer it. You are not alone.\r This website is built using Hugo, a static site builder. Static sites are quicker, more secure, and separate content from container, thus making them more sustainable. I write all of the content in individual text files, which I can then turn into whatever output - html, pdf, word doc - that I need. My writing is freed from subscription-based software that might lock it in. I push all of the text files onto github (you can see them here.) Then, I have netlify.com watch those files for any changes. When it spots changes, it uses Hugo to turn them into html, and serves them up at craftingdh.netlify.com.\nSome of the work we do requires working with the command line or the terminal of your computer; I also provide a virtual computer that you can access through your browser so that you don\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about configuring your particular machine to do any one task. This also allows me to write instructions once, and know that everyone will be able to do it (there are always differences between Mac and PC that trip us up). The virtual computer is provided by a service called Binder; I set up a folder on Github with the required bits-and-pieces (think of them as lego blocks) that are necessary for a particular task. I then point Binder at that folder, and it spins up a virtual computer with those pieces properly installed. It then gives me a URL that I can share with you - link on it, and boom! a computer in the cloud ready to go.\nAll of this is now under the \u0026lsquo;weekly work\u0026rsquo; part of this site. Take your time, annotate the parts that are confusing or troublesome with hypothes.is and you\u0026rsquo;ll do well.\nOne last thing I asked Twitter for its thoughts, as you do:\n.twitter-tweet { font: 14px/1.45 -apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,\"Segoe UI\",Roboto,Oxygen-Sans,Ubuntu,Cantarell,\"Helvetica Neue\",sans-serif; border-left: 4px solid #2b7bb9; padding-left: 1.5em; color: #555; } .twitter-tweet a { color: #2b7bb9; text-decoration: none; } blockquote.twitter-tweet a:hover, blockquote.twitter-tweet a:focus { text-decoration: underline; }  5 top [method/skills] things students new to digital history should learn.

That is to say, we don\u0026rsquo;t have many tools for dealing with video as video, as a moving image, and analyzing with an eye towards the specific affordances of the medium (but see Arnold and Tilton\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;Distant Viewing\u0026rsquo; project, and their position paper.)\nBut we\u0026rsquo;re good with text. In this bonus exercise, you\u0026rsquo;ll download a video from youtube of Dr. Martin Luther King\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;I have a dream\u0026rsquo; speech (wikipedia), and use Google\u0026rsquo;s speech-to-text engine to generate a time-stamped transcript of the speech.\nNB. This works with historic audio recordings too, but of course, the better the audio quality, the better the transcript. You could even record yourself speaking and use this to make a transcript of audio notes.\nGet the code We\u0026rsquo;re going to use this repository by Alex Kras; you can read his original blog post describing his project here.\n  Open terminal or anaconda powershell, and make a new python environment with conda create -n audio python=3.7 anaconda\n  activate your environment: conda activate audio\n  get the repository with: git clone https://github.com/akras14/speech-to-text.git\n  change directories so that you\u0026rsquo;re in that repo: cd speech-to-text\n  install the necessary bits-and-pieces that Kras put into his requirements file: pip install -r requirements.txt\n  Getting access to the Google API Follow Kras\u0026rsquo;s instructions to get an api key to access the speech-to-text engine:\n Sign up for the free tier and then sign in to Google Cloud Console Click “APIs \u0026amp; Services” Click “Credentials” Click “Create Credentials” Select “Service Account Key” Under “Service Account” select “New service account” Name service (whatever you’d like) Select Role: “Project” -\u0026gt; “Owner” Leave “JSON” option selected Click “Create” Save generated API key file Rename file to api-key.json  The file api-key.json needs to be saved inside your copy of the speech-to-text folder (eg, \\speech-to-text\\api-key.json). Note that Google sometimes changes up its interface a bit, and so the exact sequence of clicks might not be the same as described above.\nSome video utilities Download and install youtube-dl or install it from the command line: pip install --upgrade youtube_dl. If you try the command line and get an error about not having permission to do this, try sudo pip install --upgrade youtube_dl. This will require you to enter your computer username and password. Note that when you enter the password, the cursor won\u0026rsquo;t move. This is old-school security in action\u0026hellip;\nDownload and install ffmpeg.\nOn a mac:\n get homebrew first (a package manager for downloading and installing things like this) here that website gives you a command to run in your terminal to download and install homebrew. Do that. then, when homebrew is installed: brew install ffmpeg  On a pc:\n download and install from here  Now let\u0026rsquo;s do this!  There\u0026rsquo;s a copy of the \u0026lsquo;I have a dream\u0026rsquo; speech uploaded by this user at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I47Y6VHc3Ms. Note the bit after ?v=. That\u0026rsquo;s the id of the video we\u0026rsquo;re after. There are several versions of each video on youtube, to account for the different kinds of devices and resolution and so on. We\u0026rsquo;ll use youtube-dl to examine the different versions of this video, so that we can find the smallest one. At the command prompt, type youtube-dl -F I47Y6VHc3Ms The -F (upper case!) tells youtube-dl to go grab all of the info and print it out for us. Each line is a different version of the video, and each line has a unique number id. We look for the line that tells us which version is smallest. Today, that\u0026rsquo;s line 249 (notice that it also tells you that this is just the audio only). So now we tell youtube-dl to download only that version: youtube-dl -f 249 I47Y6VHc3Ms. The -f (lower case!) flag lets us select the line number we want, and then the ID string tells youtube which video we\u0026rsquo;re after. Use your file explorer to rename the file that you just downloaded to something sensible; I changed mine to \u0026lsquo;mlk.webm\u0026rsquo;. Now we\u0026rsquo;ll convert the file to a .wav file with the ffmpeg command: ffmpeg -i mlk.webm mlk.wav Move the file into the /source folder. Now we\u0026rsquo;re ready to chop the file into 30 second increments. Here we go: ffmpeg -i source/mlk.wav -f segment -segment_time 30 -c copy parts/out%09d.wav But before we pass those to google, note that files that contain dead air or nothing that is recognizable as speech can break things. Listen to the first two or three files you just created (in your file explorer, click on them). Delete the ones that are dead air. \u0026hellip;and now pass on the remaining filesto Google for processing! Make sure you\u0026rsquo;re in the correct location (eg, the speech-to-text folder) and type python slow.py \u0026gt; results.txt  A little progress bar will appear, and your code is passing your files one at a time up to google for processing; google is sending back to you the text! When it\u0026rsquo;s done, just open up the results.txt file.\nIf you have audio from other sources you\u0026rsquo;d like to try, just follow the pattern for converting it to .wav format, place it in the correct place (\\source), clean out the \\parts subdirectory, modify the command in step 7 with your own file name, and away you\u0026rsquo;ll go!\n","description":"instructions","id":33,"section":"week","tags":null,"title":"This week's bonus","uri":"https://craftingdh.netlify.com/week/2/bonus/"},{"content":"Do Reflect ","description":"Final Submission Instructions","id":34,"section":"week","tags":null,"title":"Final Submission Instructions","uri":"https://craftingdh.netlify.com/week/6-5/instructions/"},{"content":" exhibit with Wax Omeka - reclaimhosting, links to tutorials Neatline - links to tutorials  ","description":"Telling the Compelling Story","id":35,"section":"week","tags":null,"title":"This Week's Bonus","uri":"https://craftingdh.netlify.com/week/5/bonus/"},{"content":"Click title to see the full Post\nLorem est tota propiore conpellat pectoribus de\npectora summo.
