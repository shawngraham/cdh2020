        <description>Introduction A regular expression (also called regex) is a powerful tool for finding and manipulating text. At its simplest, a regular expression is just a way of looking through texts to locate patterns. When you search a website for instance (use ctrl+f in most applications to search, by the way), the search box finds exact matches; there&amp;rsquo;s no room for fuzziness. A regular expression on the other hand can help you find every line that begins with a number, or every instance of an email address, or whenever a word is used even if there are slight variations in how it&amp;rsquo;s spelled.</description>

        <description>When you look at the correspondence.csv you created, you&amp;rsquo;ll see that some names appear multiple times. You may also have noticed that many of the names suffered from errors in the text scan (OCR or Optical Character Recognition errors), rendering some identical names in the original document as similar, but not the same, in the file. For example the recipient &amp;ldquo;Juan de Dios Cafiedo&amp;rdquo; is occasionally listed as &amp;ldquo;Juan de Dios CaAedo&amp;rdquo;.</description>

        <description>Recall that the index of the collected letters of the Republic of Texas was just a list of letters from so-and-so to so-and-so. We haven&amp;rsquo;t looked at the content of those letters, but the shape of network — the meta data of that correspondence — can be revealing (remember Paul Revere!) When we stitch that together into a network of people connected because they exchanged letters, we end up with a shard of their social network.</description>

        <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in other network tools or data cleaning tools, drop me a line. Many folks use R and R Studio and its various network analysis packages, which have the edge over Gephi in that we can write the script and share that, rather than long, tortured step-by-step &amp;lsquo;click this&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;click that&amp;rsquo; type instructions.
Ah, what the hang, here we go.
