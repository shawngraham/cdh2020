That\u0026rsquo;s a nice way of thinking about it. Of course, much of the data that we are \u0026lsquo;given\u0026rsquo; wasn\u0026rsquo;t really given willingly. When we topic model Martha Ballard\u0026rsquo;s diary, did she give this to us? Of course, she couldn\u0026rsquo;t have imagined what we might try to do to it. Other kinds of data - census data, for instance - were compelled: folks had to answer the questions, on pain of punishment. This is all to suggest that there is a moral dimension to what we do with big data in history. Johanna Drucker famously framed it as data versus capta, or \u0026lsquo;things captured.\u0026rsquo;\nThis week, we\u0026rsquo;re thinking about some of the ways historical materials find their ways online, and we\u0026rsquo;re learning some of the ways we can pull that information onto our own machines for our own research.

By installing Anaconda, you get access to a series of tools for working in both the Python and R programming languages, plus excellent visual interfaces that reduce (some of) the pain of programming.\nWhen we do work in python, we sometimes need to add more lego-pieces to what we\u0026rsquo;re doing, to accomplish specific tasks. Anaconda comes with very nearly - but not all - of the pieces you might need. The thing is, different tasks might require the same pieces, and if you\u0026rsquo;ve ever fought with a sibling over who gets the good lego piece, well, that\u0026rsquo;s what can happen inside your machine. Anaconda keeps everything playing nice by allowing us to create environments with copies of the pieces we need, separate from other copies, so that there are no conflicts.\nAnaconda also gives us some excellent user interfaces for doing our work - juypter notebooks and R Studio - for instance. In this course, we\u0026rsquo;ll use R Studio a bit, and we\u0026rsquo;ll take a look at some jupyter notebooks, but we\u0026rsquo;ll mostly use python at the command line.\nDownload Download Anaconda From Here\nDouble-click the downloaded file to install.\nAccept all of the defaults during the installation. (More info on the installation process is here).\nAnaconda comes with something called \u0026lsquo;Anaconda Navigator\u0026rsquo;, which looks like this:\nPowershell and Terminal We may occasionally launch some of these apps (eg, Jupyter Notebooks, R Studio). For now, we\u0026rsquo;ll be using the command line. Windows users in particular: we\u0026rsquo;ll be using the \u0026lsquo;powershell\u0026rsquo;. You can click on the \u0026lsquo;Powershell Prompt\u0026rsquo; in Anaconda Navigator. You can also find it by searching your pc for \u0026lsquo;Anaconda Powershell\u0026rsquo;.\n  When I ask you to use the command prompt, Windows users: I mean anaconda powershell.\n  Mac users can use the terminal (which you can find under applications -\u0026gt; other -\u0026gt; terminal).\n  Going forward, when I want you to enter code at the command prompt or terminal prompt, I will signal this by starting the line with a $, like this:\n$ echo \u0026quot;this is what it looks like\u0026quot;\nYou do not type the $.\nOpen a command prompt or terminal now and confirm that anaconda is installed:\n$ conda --version\nand that python is installed:\n$ python --version\nif you get an error message, then anaconda did not install correctly or Windows users you might not be in anaconda powershell.\nWhen we type \u0026lsquo;conda\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;python\u0026rsquo; or indeed \u0026lsquo;echo\u0026rsquo; or anything else at the prompt, we are telling the computer that this is a command. If we want the machine to run a particular python program we\u0026rsquo;ve written, we would invoke python followed by the program name, eg example.py so that the machine knows to open example.py with python.\nNavigating the Commandline When you click on a file in your windows explorer or in mac\u0026rsquo;s finder, you click through nested folders, right? The path you take through those folders will look something like this: username\\example-folder\\a-subfolder\\file.txt, although finder or explorer by default don\u0026rsquo;t show you that.\nWhen you open anaconda powershell or the terminal, how do you know where you are at? You print the working directory:\n$ pwd\nand that will give you the path to where you are working. To see what\u0026rsquo;s inside the folder, you can:\n$ ls list files, on a Mac or\n$ dir directory, on a PC\nFiles will have an extension (eg, .txt, .doc) while directories won\u0026rsquo;t.

If you spot someone asking for help and you can offer advice, respond to the annotation. Introduction Github is a code sharing website often used by digital historians. \u0026lsquo;Git\u0026rsquo; is a program that takes snapshots of the current state of a folder, and stores them in sequence, allowing you to revert your changes to an earlier state. It also allows you to create branches, or duplicates of your folder, so you can experiment. If you like the results of your work, you can merge that branch back into your original.\nGithub therefore is a hub for sharing these git snapshots.\nA branch (a copy, a duplicate) of your work uploaded to Github could therefore be copied to say my account (a fork); then I might download to my machine to work on it (I\u0026rsquo;ve pulled it). Once I\u0026rsquo;m happy with my changes, I commit them (save them to the sequence of changes that Git tracks), and then I could push those changes to the fork in my account. I would then send you a pull notice, asking you to pull my changes back to your account; you could then decide whether or not to merge.\nFor our purposes, you will use Github mostly as a place to put your reflections or other pieces of work. I might sometimes fork your work, pull it down onto my machine, make changes that I commit, push it back online, and ask you to pull the changes back. But that won\u0026rsquo;t happen very often. It takes a while to get comfortable with this.\nGet your account  Got to github.com and sign up for an account. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to use your real name. (Protip: You might want to set up an email just for signing up for things.)  Verify your account.  Select the free tier (nb: I will never require you to pay for any reading, or any software. If something wants you to pay, stop and ask for help).  Skip telling Github anything about yourself.  Do the verification email thing. Once you hit the verification link in your email, you\u0026rsquo;ll be brought back to Github to make a new repository:  Give it a reasonable name; tick the \u0026lsquo;initialize with a readme\u0026rsquo; box, and hit the green commit button:  And on the final page, hit the \u0026lsquo;dismiss\u0026rsquo; button in the \u0026lsquo;Github Actions box\u0026rsquo;  Ta Da! You now have a github account, and you\u0026rsquo;ve created your first repository. Going Forward create a new repository for each week\u0026rsquo;s work/reflection. You can create a new repository from the plus sign in the top right corner:\nnb Remember to tick off the \u0026lsquo;initialize with a readme.md\u0026rsquo; file.\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;ve done that, you\u0026rsquo;ll be at your Github user page:\nSetting up a \u0026lsquo;repository\u0026rsquo; for your work A \u0026lsquo;repository\u0026rsquo; is just a folder that you\u0026rsquo;ve shared on Github. There are two ways to do this; the easy way and the more complex way. Luck you, you have already done the easy way - you selected the initialize with a readme, and it\u0026rsquo;s already present in your browser!\nTo create new repositories, just click on the + button on the top right of your Github page when you\u0026rsquo;re logged in. You might want to go ahead now and create repositories for week 2 through to week 6. Remember to tick off the initialize with a readme box. But if you didn\u0026rsquo;t tick the initialize box, you\u0026rsquo;ve embarked on the more complex way. In the screenshot below, I created a new repository but I forgot to initialize it, and now I\u0026rsquo;m looking at this page:\nIf this is you, do not despair.\nWhen you\u0026rsquo;ve forgotten to initialize a new repo:  If you have a PC, click on this link to download and install git. Make a new directory on your computer with the same name as the repo you created above. In my example, that would be week-two. On a PC, right-click on the folder and select \u0026lsquo;open a command prompt here\u0026rsquo;. On a Mac, go to System Preferences, select Keyboard \u0026gt; Shortcuts \u0026gt; Services. Look for \u0026lsquo;New Terminal at Folder\u0026rsquo; and tick the box. Open your finder; find the folder you created, right-click and select \u0026lsquo;open Terminal here\u0026rsquo;. Do you see where, in your browser at github, it says ...or create a new repository on the command line? Type in each line exactly as it is there (beginning with echo), hitting enter at the end of each line, in order. If the command works, you\u0026rsquo;ll just be presented with the next prompt. The computer only ever responds when there is output to print - which often means only when there is an error message to report.  Ta da! You can now go to github.com\\\u0026lt;your-user-name\u0026gt;\\your-repo and you\u0026rsquo;ll see it all there tickety boo.\nMaking a new text file on Github You can make a new text file by clicking on the \u0026lsquo;create new file\u0026rsquo; button; remember to always use .md as the file extension. You can specify headers, links, images, bullets, blockquotes and so on by using markdown conventions\nThe two videos below might be a bit clearer on youtube itself.\n  Uploading a file into Github You can add new files from your computer by dragging and dropping them into the main repository. At the end of this video, I show you how to display the image in the text of the reflection.\n  Going further Github can also be used to run an entire website, generated from your text files. In fact, that\u0026rsquo;s how I built this course website! The following three links are from my HIST4806a 2020 seminar on digital history and museums; they will walk you through how to use your Github account to serve up a professional scholarly website; you can use this scholarly website to host your reflections and course work, if you want.

At its simplest, a regular expression is just a way of looking through texts to locate patterns. When you search a website for instance (use ctrl+f in most applications to search, by the way), the search box finds exact matches; there\u0026rsquo;s no room for fuzziness. A regular expression on the other hand can help you find every line that begins with a number, or every instance of an email address, or whenever a word is used even if there are slight variations in how it\u0026rsquo;s spelled. As long as you can describe the pattern you\u0026rsquo;re looking for, regular expressions can help you find it. Once you\u0026rsquo;ve found your patterns, they can then help you manipulate your text so that it fits just what you need.\nRegular expressions can look pretty complex, but once you know the basic syntax and vocabulary, simple ‘regexes’ will be easy. Regular expressions can often be used right inside the \u0026lsquo;Find and Replace\u0026rsquo; box in many text and document editors, such as Sublime Text, Atom, or Notepad++. You cannot use Microsoft Word, however!\nNB In text editors, you have to indicate that you wish to do a regex search. In Sublime Text, you open the search panel from the \u0026lsquo;Find\u0026rsquo; menu (or use the shortcut) and then you need to tick the box that has .* in the search panel to enable regular expression searches.\nSome basic principles Protip: there are libraries of regular expressions, online. For example, if you want to find all postal codes, you can search “regular expression Canadian postal code” and learn what ‘formula’ to search for to find them.\nAlso, here is a cheatsheet for regular expressions in Sublime Text.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s say you\u0026rsquo;re looking for all the instances of \u0026ldquo;cat\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;dog\u0026rdquo; in your document. When you type the vertical bar on your keyboard (it looks like |, shift+backslash on windows keyboards), that means \u0026lsquo;or\u0026rsquo; in regular expressions. So, if your query is dog|cat and you press \u0026lsquo;find\u0026rsquo;, it will show you the first time either dog or cat appears in your text.\nIf you want to replace every instance of either \u0026ldquo;cat\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;dog\u0026rdquo; in your document with the world \u0026ldquo;animal\u0026rdquo;, you would open your find-and-replace box, put dog|cat in the search query, put animal in the \u0026lsquo;replace\u0026rsquo; box, hit \u0026lsquo;replace all\u0026rsquo;, and watch your entire document fill up with references to animals instead of dogs and cats.\nThe astute reader will have noticed a problem with the instructions above; simply replacing every instance of \u0026ldquo;dog\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;cat\u0026rdquo; with \u0026ldquo;animal\u0026rdquo; is bound to create problems. Simple searches don\u0026rsquo;t differentiate between letters and spaces, so every time \u0026ldquo;cat\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;dog\u0026rdquo; appear within words, they\u0026rsquo;ll also be replaced with \u0026ldquo;animal\u0026rdquo;. \u0026ldquo;catch\u0026rdquo; will become \u0026ldquo;animalch\u0026rdquo;; \u0026ldquo;dogma\u0026rdquo; will become \u0026ldquo;animalma\u0026rdquo;; \u0026ldquo;certificate\u0026rdquo; will become \u0026ldquo;certifianimale\u0026rdquo;. In this case, the solution appears simple; put a space before and after your search query, so now it reads:\ndog | cat\nWith the spaces, \u0026ldquo;animal\u0026rdquo; replace \u0026ldquo;dog\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;cat\u0026rdquo; only in those instances where they\u0026rsquo;re definitely complete words; that is, when they\u0026rsquo;re separated by spaces.\nThe even more astute reader will notice that this still does not solve our problem of replacing every instance of \u0026ldquo;dog\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;cat\u0026rdquo;. What if the word comes at the beginning of a line, so it is not in front of a space? What if the word is at the end of a sentence or a clause, and thus followed by a punctuation? Luckily, in the language of regex, you can represent the beginning or end of a word using special characters.\n\\\u0026lt;\nmeans the beginning of a word. In some programs, you might use this alternative:\n\\b\nso if you search for \\\u0026lt;cat , (or, as it may be, \\bcat )it will find \u0026ldquo;cat\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;catch\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;catsup\u0026rdquo;, but not \u0026ldquo;copycat\u0026rdquo;, because your query searched for words beginning with \u0026ldquo;cat\u0026rdquo;. For patterns at the end of the line, you would use:\n\\\u0026gt; or \\b\nagain. If you therefore searched:\ncat\\\u0026gt;\nit will find \u0026ldquo;cat\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;copycat\u0026rdquo;, but not \u0026ldquo;catch,\u0026rdquo; because your query searched for words ending with -\u0026ldquo;cat\u0026rdquo;.\nRegular expressions can be mixed, so if you wanted to find words only matching \u0026ldquo;cat\u0026rdquo;, no matter where in the sentence, you\u0026rsquo;d search for\n\\\u0026lt;cat\\\u0026gt;\nwhich would find every instance. And, because all regular expressions can be mixed, if you searched for\n\\\u0026lt;cat|dog\\\u0026gt;\nand replaced all with \u0026ldquo;animal\u0026rdquo;, you would have a document that replaced all instances of \u0026ldquo;dog\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;cat\u0026rdquo; with \u0026ldquo;animal\u0026rdquo;, no matter where in the sentence they appear. You can also search for variations within a single word using parentheses. For example if you were looking for instances of \u0026ldquo;gray\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;grey\u0026rdquo;, instead of the search query\ngray|grey\nyou could type\ngr(a|e)y\ninstead. The parentheses signify a group, and like the order of operations in arithmetic, regular expressions read the parentheses before anything else. Similarly, if you wanted to find instances of either \u0026ldquo;that dog\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;that cat\u0026rdquo;, you would search for:\n(that dog)|(that cat)\nNotice that the vertical bar | can appear either inside or outside the parentheses, depending on what you want to search for.\nThe period character . in regular expressions directs the search to just find any character at all. For example, if we searched for:\nd.g\nthe search would return \u0026ldquo;dig\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;dog\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;dug\u0026rdquo;, and so forth.\nAnother special character from our cheat sheet, the plus symbol + instructs the program to find any number of the previous character. If we search for\ndo+g\nit would return any words that looked like \u0026ldquo;dog\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;doog\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;dooog\u0026rdquo;, and so forth. Adding parentheses before the plus would make a search for repetitions of whatever is in the parentheses, for example querying\n(do)+g\nwould return \u0026ldquo;dog\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;dodog\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;dododog\u0026rdquo;, and so forth.\nCombining the plus + and period . characters can be particularly powerful in regular expressions, instructing the program to find any amount of any characters within your search. A search for\nd.+g\nfor example, might return \u0026ldquo;dried fruits are g\u0026rdquo;, because the string begins with \u0026ldquo;d\u0026rdquo; and ends with \u0026ldquo;g\u0026rdquo;, and has various characters in the middle. Searching for simply .+ will yield query results that are entire lines of text, because you are searching for any character, and any amount of them.\nParentheses in regular expressions are also very useful when replacing text. The text within a regular expression forms what\u0026rsquo;s called a group, and the software you use to search remembers which groups you queried in order of their appearance. For example, if you search for\n(dogs)( and )(cats)\nwhich would find all instances of \u0026ldquo;dogs and cats\u0026rdquo; in your document, your program would remember \u0026ldquo;dogs\u0026rdquo; is group 1, \u0026ldquo;and\u0026rdquo; is group 2, and \u0026ldquo;cats\u0026rdquo; is group 3. Sublime Text remembers them as \\1, \\2, and \\3 for each group respectively.\nIf you wanted to switch the order of \u0026ldquo;dogs\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;cats\u0026rdquo; every time the phrase \u0026ldquo;dogs and cats\u0026rdquo; appeared in your document, you would type\n(dogs)( and )(cats)\nin the \u0026lsquo;find\u0026rsquo; box, and\n\\3\\2\\1\nin the \u0026lsquo;replace\u0026rsquo; box. That would replace the entire string with group 3 (\u0026ldquo;cats\u0026rdquo;) in the first spot, group 2 (\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;) in the second spot, and group 1 (\u0026ldquo;dogs\u0026rdquo;) in the last spot, thus changing the result to \u0026ldquo;cats and dogs\u0026rdquo;.\nThe vocabulary of regular expressions is pretty large, but there are many cheat sheets for regex online.\nLetters of the Republic of Texas The correspondence of the Republic of Texas, and independent state from 1835 to 1846 was collated into a single volume and published with a helpful index in 1911. It was scanned and OCR\u0026rsquo;d by Google, and is now available as a text file from the Internet Archive. You can see the OCR\u0026rsquo;d text at archive.org. We are going to use it to practice our regex skills because it is an example of a historical network we might want to analyze later with network analysis. We are going to grab the index from that file, and transform it using regex.\nEntries in the index look like this:\nSam Houston to A. B. Roman, September 12, 1842 101 Sam Houston to A. B. Roman, October 29, 1842 101 Correspondence for 1843-1846 — Isaac Van Zandt to Anson Jones, January 11, 1843 103 We are going to use regex to tidy this up, delete some parts, and end up with data that looks like this:\nSam Houston, A. B. Roman, September 12 1842 Sam Houston, A. B. Roman, October 29 1842 Isaac Van Zandt, Anson Jones, January 11 1843 The change doesn\u0026rsquo;t look like much, and you might think to yourself, \u0026lsquo;hey, I could just do that by hand\u0026rsquo;. You could but it\u0026rsquo;d take you ages, and if you made a mistake somewhere, are you sure you could do this consistently, for a couple of hours at a time? Probably not. Your time is better spent figuring out the search and replace patterns, and then setting your machine loose to implement it.\n  We will use the curl command at the command prompt to grab the file; this is a related command to wget whom you\u0026rsquo;ve already met. Mac users should already have this installed; Windows users can open up Anaconda PowerShell and type conda install -c anaconda curl to get it.\n  At the command line, type the following curl command:\n  $ curl http://archive.org/stream/diplomaticcorre33statgoog/diplomaticcorre33statgoog_djvu.txt \u0026gt; texas.txt\nThe curl command downloads the txt file and the the \u0026gt; pushes the result of the command to a file called texas.txt.\n Open texas.txt in Sublime Text, and open the Find menu and hit the Replace option; this opens the find and replace panel at the bottom of your window. Make sure to press the .* button in that panel to turn on regular expression search.\n  Delete everything in this file that isn\u0026rsquo;t the table of letters. The table starts with ‘Sam Houston to J. Pinckney Henderson, December 31, 1836 51’ and ends with ‘Wm. Henry Daingerfield to Ebenezer Allen, February 2, 1846 1582’. Your file will now have approximately 2000 lines in it.\n  First thing we\u0026rsquo;re going to do is identify any lines that indicate correspondence. We\u0026rsquo;re going to look for the word \u0026lsquo;to\u0026rsquo;. In fact, we don\u0026rsquo;t just want to find \u0026ldquo;to\u0026rdquo;, but the entire line that contains it. We assume that every line that contains the word \u0026ldquo;to\u0026rdquo; in full is a line that has relevant letter information, and every line that does not is one we do not need.\n  You learned earlier that the pattern .+ returns any amount of text, no matter what it says, and that \\b indicates a word boundary. Thus, the pattern we want looks like this .+\\bto\\b.+. Don\u0026rsquo;t search yet.\nWe want to mark these lines off as special, so let\u0026rsquo;s add a tilde ~ before each of the lines that look like letters. This involves the find-and-replace function, and a query identical to the one before, but with parentheses around it, so it looks like the following\n(.+\u0026lt;to\u0026gt;)\nand the entire line is placed within a parenthetical group. Since this the first group in our search expression, we can replace that group with \\1 and put the tilde in front of it like so: ~\\1.\nDo this\nsearch for: (.+\\\u0026lt;to\\\u0026gt;)\nreplace with: ~\\1\nAfter running the find-and-replace, you should note your document now has most of the lines with tildes in front of it, and a few which do not. The next step is to remove all the lines that do not include a tilde. The search string to find all lines which don\u0026rsquo;t begin with tildes is \\n[^~].+  Within a set of square brackets [] the carrot ^ means search for anything that isn\u0026rsquo;t within these brackets (in this case, the tilde ~). The .+ as before means search for every remaining character in the line as well. All together, the query returns any full line which does not begin with a tilde; that is, the lines we did not mark as looking like letters. We search for the pattern, and leave the replace blank; this will delete the lines that do not begin with a tilde.\nDo this\nsearch for: \\n[^~].+\nreplace with:\nTo turn this text file into a csv suitable for network analysis, we\u0026rsquo;ll want to separate it out into one column for Sender, one for Recipient, and one for Date, each separated by a single comma. Notice that most lines have extraneous page numbers attached to them; we can get rid of those with regular expressions. There\u0026rsquo;s also usually a comma separating the month-date and the year, which we\u0026rsquo;ll get rid of as well. In the end, the first line should go from looking like the following:  ~Sam Houston to J. Pinckney Henderson, December 31, 1836 51\nto looking like the following:\nSam Houston, J. Pinckney Henderson, December 31 1836\nRead through before you do anything. You will start by removing the page number after the year and the comma between the year and the month-date. To do this, first locate the year on each line by using the regex:\n[0-9]{4}\nWe can find any digit between 0 and 9 by searching for [0-9], and {4} will find four of them together. Now extend that search out by appending .+ to the end of the query; as seen before, it will capture the entire rest of the line. The following query:\n`[0-9]{4}.+`  will return, for example, \u0026ldquo;1836 51\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;1839 52\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;1839 53\u0026rdquo; from the first three lines of the text. We also want to capture the comma preceding the year, so add a comma and a space before the query, resulting in the following:\n `, [0-9]{4}.+`  which will return \u0026ldquo;, 1836 51\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;, 1839 52\u0026rdquo;, etc.\nThe next step is making the parenthetical groups which will be used to remove parts of the text with find-and-replace. In this case, we want to remove the comma and everything after \u0026lsquo;year\u0026rsquo;, but not the year or the space before it. Thus our query will look like the following:\n`(,)( [0-9]{4})(.+)`  with the comma as the first group \\1, the space and the year as the second \\2, and the rest of the line as the third \\3. Given that all we care about retaining is the second group (we want to keep the year, but not the comma or the page number), what will the replace look like? You only want to keep the second group.\n  It\u0026#39;ll look like this  search: (,)( [0-9]{4})(.+)\nreplace: \\2\nNow go ahead and do that.\n   Find the tildes that we used to mark off our text of interest, and replace them with nothing to delete them.\n  Finally, to separate the Sender and Receiver by a comma, we find all instances of the word \u0026ldquo;to\u0026rdquo; and replace it with a comma. Although we used \\b and \\b to denote the beginning and end of a word earlier in the lesson, we don\u0026rsquo;t exactly do that here. We include the space preceding \u0026ldquo;to\u0026rdquo; in the regular expression, as well as the  \\b to denote the word ending. Once we find instances of the word and the space preceding it, to\\b we replace it with a comma ,.\n  Do this\nsearch: (\\b to \\b)\nreplace: ,\n You now have a document that contains senders, recipients, and the date in three columns separated by commas. Well done! You\u0026rsquo;ll need to insert a line right at line 1 though to make this clear: at the top of the file, add a new line that simply reads \u0026ldquo;Sender, Recipient, Date\u0026rdquo;.\n  You may notice that some lines still do not fit our criteria. Line 22, for example, reads \u0026ldquo;Abner S. Lipscomb, James Hamilton and A. T. Bumley, AugUHt 15, \u0026ldquo;. It has an incomplete date; we don\u0026rsquo;t need to worry about these for our purposes.\n  More worrisome are lines, like 61 \u0026ldquo;Copy and summary of instructions United States Department of State, \u0026quot; which include none of the information we want. We can get rid of these lines later in a spreadsheet.\nThe only non-standard lines we need to worry about with regular expressions are the ones with more than 2 commas, like line 178, \u0026ldquo;A. J. Donelson, Secretary of State [Allen,. arf interim], December 10 1844\u0026rdquo;. Notice that our second column, the name of the Recipient, has a comma inside of it. If you were to import this directly into a spreadsheet, you would get four columns, one for Sender, two for Recipient, and one for date, which would break any analysis you would then like to run. Unfortunately these lines need to be fixed by hand, but happily regular expressions make finding them easy. The following query:\n.+,.+,.+,\nwill show you every line with more than 2 commas, because it finds any line that has any set of characters, then a comma, then any other set, then another comma, and so forth. You can just \u0026lsquo;find all\u0026rsquo; and then Sublime will show you the lines to fix manually.\nPhew That was a lot of work. Save your file with a new name: correspondence.csv. You now have a document that can be visualized as a network and analyzed as such.\nBut it\u0026rsquo;s still pretty messy - it was, after all, OCR\u0026rsquo;d in the first place. We\u0026rsquo;ll fix that in the open refine exercise.\n","description":"Basic Tools","id":7,"section":"week","tags":null,"title":"REGEX","uri":"https://craftingdh.netlify.com/week/3/regex/"},{"content":"voyant\n","description":"Of Macroscopes and Microscopes","id":8,"section":"week","tags":null,"title":"Voyant","uri":"https://craftingdh.netlify.com/week/4/voyant/"},{"content":" audacity sonification  ","description":"Telling the Compelling Story","id":9,"section":"week","tags":null,"title":"Sound","uri":"https://craftingdh.netlify.com/week/5/sound/"},{"content":"   While watching this video, turn on the closed captions.\nCreate an account at hypothes.is:\nGet the Chrome app or the Firefox bookmarklet:\nMake sure you\u0026rsquo;re logged in:\nThen join our HIST3814o reading group.

It is extremely powerful: if we do it wrong we can look like an attacker, or worse, download the entire internet! We use this program on the command line. We will cover some of the basics, and then we will create a little program that uses wget to download materials from Library and Archives Canada.\nIn what follows, push yourself until you get stuck. I\u0026rsquo;m not interested in how far you get, but rather in how you document what you are able to do, how you look for help, how you reach out to others - or how you help others over the bumps. I know also that you all have lots of other claims on your time. Reading through all of this and making notes on what you do/don\u0026rsquo;t understand is fine too.\r Installation Mac Users\nYou will need a tool called \u0026lsquo;homebrew\u0026rsquo; to obtain wget. Homebrew is a \u0026lsquo;package manager\u0026rsquo;, or a utility that retrieves software from a single, \u0026lsquo;official\u0026rsquo; (as it were) source. To install home brew, copy the command below and enter it at your terminal:\n$ /usr/bin/ruby -e \u0026quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\u0026quot; Then, make sure everything is set up correctly with brew, enter: $ brew doctor\nAssuming all has gone well, get wget: $ brew install wget\nThen test that it installed: $ wget If it has installed, you\u0026rsquo;ll get the message -\u0026gt; missing URL.. If it hasn\u0026rsquo;t you\u0026rsquo;ll see -\u0026gt; command not found.\nWindows\nGo to this website and right-click, \u0026lsquo;save target as\u0026rsquo; the file for the 32-bit version 1.20.3 EXE file.\nMove this file out of your Downloads folder into your C:\\Windows directory. That way, when you type wget at the command prompt, Windows will find it.\nBasic Usage Wget expects you to enter the URL to a webpage or some other online file. How do websites organize things? Milligan writes:\n Let’s take an example dataset. Say you wanted to download all of the papers hosted on the website ActiveHistory.ca. They are all located at: http://activehistory.ca/papers/; in the sense that they are all contained within the /papers/ directory: for example, the 9th paper published on the website is http://activehistory.ca/papers/historypaper-9/. Think of this structure in the same way as directories on your own computer: if you have a folder labeled /History/, it likely contains several files within it. The same structure holds true for websites, and we are using this logic to tell our computer what files we want to download.\n So let\u0026rsquo;s try to do that. At the command prompt or terminal, let\u0026rsquo;s make a new directory to do our work in:\n$ mkdir wget-activehistory $ cd wget-activehistory and let\u0026rsquo;s grab the index page from the papers directory:\n$ wget http://activehistory.ca/papers/\nta da! Look around in that directory, see what got downloaded.\nBut that was only one file. We\u0026rsquo;re going to add some more flags to the command to tell wget to recursively follow links (using the -r flag) in that folder but to only follow the links that lead to destinations within the folder (using the -np meaning \u0026lsquo;no parent\u0026rsquo;). Otherwise we could end up grabbing materials five steps away from this site! (If we did want materials outside of where we started, we\u0026rsquo;d use the -l flag, \u0026lsquo;links\u0026rsquo;). Finally, we don\u0026rsquo;t want to be attacking the site demanding gimme gimme gimme materials. We use the -w flag to wait between requests, and to --limit-rate=20k to narrow the bandwidth our request requires.\n -r recursive -np no-parent -l links beyond domain we started in -w wait time between requests to the server --limit-rate= limit the bandwidth for our request (which necessarily slows down how long it\u0026rsquo;ll take to perform the request)  Altogether, our command now looks like this:\n$ wget -r -np -w 2 --limit-rate=20k http://activehistory.ca/papers/\nGive that a try!\nUsing wget with a list of urls Let us assume that you were very interested in the history of health care in this country. Through the Library and Archives Canada search interface, you\u0026rsquo;ve found the Laura A. Gamble fonds, a nurse originally from Wakefield Quebec (just north of Ottawa).\nYou click through, and find the first image of her diary; if you right-click on that image and select view image you find that the file path to the image: http://data2.archives.ca/e/e001/e000000422.jpg.\nNow, if Library and Archives Canada had an API for their collection (an \u0026lsquo;application programming interface\u0026rsquo;, or a set of commands that we could use on our end to deduce the locations of the information we want), we could just figure out the urls for each image of the diary in that fonds. But they don\u0026rsquo;t. Turns out, the urls we want run from \u0026hellip;422 to \u0026hellip;425 (but try entering other numbers at the end of that URL: you will retrieve who-knows-what!):\n In sublime text, create a new file and paste these urls into it; save the file as urls.txt  http://data2.archives.ca/e/e001/e000000422.jpg http://data2.archives.ca/e/e001/e000000423.jpg http://data2.archives.ca/e/e001/e000000424.jpg http://data2.archives.ca/e/e001/e000000425.jpg Now, we know that we can pass an indivual url to wget and wget will retrieve it; we can also pass urls.txt to wget, and wget will grab every file in turn!\nTry this at the terminal/command prompt:  $ wget -i urls.txt -r --no-parent -nd -w 2 --limit-rate=100k\n(google for wget options)\nUsing python to generate a list of urls Now, let\u0026rsquo;s try something a bit more complex. It\u0026rsquo;s one thing to manually copy and paste urls into a file, but what if we want a lot of files? You could just set wget to crawl directories, but that can make you look like an attacker, it can clutter your own machine with files you don\u0026rsquo;t want, and it can mess with your bandwidth and data caps. Sometimes though we can suss out the naming pattern for files, and so write a small program that will automatically write out all of the urls for us.\nConsider the 14th Canadian General Hospital war diaries. The URLs of this diary go from http://data2.archives.ca/e/e061/e001518029.jpg to http://data2.archives.ca/e/e061/e001518109.jpg. That\u0026rsquo;s 80 pages.\n make a new directory for our work - at the command prompt or terminal, $ mkdir war-diaries Create a new file in Sublime Text. I\u0026rsquo;ll give you the script to paste in there, and then I\u0026rsquo;ll explain what it\u0026rsquo;s doing.  1 2 3 4 5 6  urls = \u0026#39;\u0026#39;; f=open(\u0026#39;urls.txt\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;w\u0026#39;) for x in range(8029, 8110): urls = \u0026#39;http://data2.collectionscanada.ca/e/e061/e00151%d.jpg\\n\u0026#39; % (x) f.write(urls) f.close   First, we\u0026rsquo;re creating an empty \u0026lsquo;bin\u0026rsquo; or varialbe called \u0026lsquo;urls\u0026rsquo;. Then, we create a variable called f for file, and tell it to open a new text file called \u0026lsquo;urls\u0026rsquo;. Then we set up a loop with the for command that will iterate over the 80 values from 8029 to 8110. The next line contains our pattern, the full url right up until e0151. The last little bit, the %d takes the number of the current iteration and pastes that in. The \\n means \u0026lsquo;new line\u0026rsquo; so that when we iterate through this again, we\u0026rsquo;ve moved the cursor down one line. Then with f.write(urls) we put the pattern into the file. Once we\u0026rsquo;ve finished - we\u0026rsquo;ve gotten all the way to 8110 - the loop is done, we close the file, and the script stops.\n Save this file as urls.py in your directory war-diaries. The .py reminds us that to run this file we\u0026rsquo;ll need to invoke it with python.\n  At the command prompt / terminal (windows: ananconda powershell remember!) make sure you are in your war-diaries directory with pwd to see where you are, and cd as appropriate to get to where you need to be.\n  Make sure the file is there: type ls or dir as appropriate and make sure you see the file. Let\u0026rsquo;s run this file: $ python urls.py. After a brief pause, you should just be presented with a new prompt, as if nothing has happened: but check your directory (ls or dir) and you\u0026rsquo;ll see a new file: urls.txt. You can open this with Sublime Text to see what\u0026rsquo;s inside.\n  Now that you\u0026rsquo;ve got the urls, use wget as you did for Laura Gamble\u0026rsquo;s diary (it\u0026rsquo;s the exact same command). It might go rather slowly, but keep an eye on your file explorer or finder. What have you got in your directory now?\n  Be a good digital citizen Always use the wait and limit-rate flags so that you do not overwhelm the server (the computer at the address of your url) with your requests. You can get yourself into trouble if you don\u0026rsquo;t. Make sure you understand the ideas around recursively following links, link depth, and \u0026lsquo;no-parents.\u0026rsquo; Read the original tutorials by Ian Milligan at The Programming Historian, and Kellen Kurschinski for more details.\n","description":"instructions","id":11,"section":"week","tags":null,"title":"Wget","uri":"https://craftingdh.netlify.com/week/2/wget/"},{"content":"When you look at the correspondence.csv you created, you\u0026rsquo;ll see that some names appear multiple times.

For example the recipient \u0026ldquo;Juan de Dios Cafiedo\u0026rdquo; is occasionally listed as \u0026ldquo;Juan de Dios CaAedo\u0026rdquo;.

I will share a copy with anyone who needs it to give this exercise a try.\r In this exercise, we are going to use the Open Refine tool that originated with Google. Since 2012, it has been open source and freely available online. Using it takes a bit of getting used to, however.\nInstallation Start by doing the following:\n Visit the Open Refine home page and watch the three videos. Download Open Refine 3.3 to your machine. Follow the installation instructions. Start Open Refine by double clicking on its icon. This will open a new browser window, pointing to http://127.0.0.1:3333. This location is your own computer, so even though it looks like it’s running on the internet, it isn’t. The 3333 is a ‘port’, meaning that Open Refine is running much like a server, serving up a webpage via that port to the browser. (If the browser window doesn\u0026rsquo;t open automatically, open one and put http://127.0.0.1:3333 in the address bar.)  Cleaning and reconciling names  Make sure Open Refine is running in your browser. Start a new project by clicking on the ‘Create project’ tab on the left side of the screen. Click on ‘Choose files’ and select the Texan correspondence CSV file. Open Refine will load this data and it will give you a preview of your data. Name your project in the box on the top right side (eg. \u0026lsquo;texasnames\u0026rsquo; or similar) and then click ‘Create project’. It may take a few minutes. Once your project has started, one of the columns that should be visible in your data is \u0026ldquo;Sender\u0026rdquo;. Click on the arrow to the left of \u0026ldquo;Sender\u0026rdquo; in OpenRefine and select Facet -\u0026gt; Text Facet. Do the same with the arrow next to \u0026ldquo;Recipient\u0026rdquo;. A box will appear on the left side of the browser showing all 189 names listed as senders in the spreadsheet. Within the \u0026ldquo;Sender\u0026rdquo; facet box on the left side, click on the button labeled \u0026ldquo;Cluster\u0026rdquo;. This feature presents various automatic ways of merging values that appear to be the same. Play with the values in the drop-down boxes and notice how the number of clusters found change depending on which method is used. Because the methods are slightly different, each will present different matches that may or may not be useful. If you see two values which look like they should be merged, e.g. Ashbel Smith and . Ashbel Smith, check the box to the right in the \u0026lsquo;Merge\u0026rsquo; column and click the \u0026lsquo;Merge Selected \u0026amp; Re-Cluster\u0026rsquo; button below. Go through the various cluster methods one-at-a-time, including changing number values, and merge the values which appear to be the same. Juan de Dios CaAedo clearly should be merged with Juan de Dios Cafiedo, however Correspondent in Tampico probably should not be merged with Correspondent at Vera Cruz. Since we are not experts, we will have to use our best judgement in these cases — or get cracking on some more research to help us make the call. By the end, you should have reduced the number of unique Senders from 189 to around 150. Repeat these steps with Recipients, reducing unique Recipients from 192 to about 160. To finish the automatic cleaning of the data, click the arrow next to \u0026ldquo;Sender\u0026rdquo; and select \u0026lsquo;Edit Cells -\u0026gt; Common transforms -\u0026gt; Trim leading and trailing whitespace\u0026rsquo;.\nRepeat step 12 for \u0026ldquo;Recipient\u0026rdquo;. The resulting spreadsheet will not be perfect, but it will be much easier to clean by hand than it would have been before taking this step.\nClick on ‘Export’ at the top right of the window to get your data back out as a .csv file.  Ta da! A file ready for some network analysis.\n   Turn on the closed captions; the video is from an earlier iteration of this course, but takes you through those steps.\n","description":"Basic Tools","id":12,"section":"week","tags":null,"title":"Open Refine","uri":"https://craftingdh.netlify.com/week/3/open-refine/"},{"content":"abreviations\nantconc\n/an example of antconc being used on 1990s juvenile literature in ways that would be completely comparable for eg scottish chapbooks database https://datasittersclub.github.io/site/dsc4/\nLang, Anouk. “DSC #4: AntConc Saves the Day.” The Data-Sitters Club.

In essence, this lets a program on your computer talk to the computer serving the website you\u0026rsquo;re interested in, such that the website gives you the data that you\u0026rsquo;re looking for.\nAn API is just a way of opening up a program so that another program can interact with it. That is, instead of an interface meant for a human to interact with the machine, there’s an API to allow some other machine to interact with this one. If you’ve ever downloaded an app on your phone that allowed you to interact with Instagram (but wasn’t Instagram itself), that interaction was through Instagram’s API, for instance.\nA good API will also have documentation explaining what or how to make calls to it to get the information you want. That is, instead of you punching in the search terms on a search page, and copying and pasting the results, you frame a request as a URL. More or less. The results often come back to you in a text format where data is organized according to keys and values (JSON). Sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s just a table of data using commas to separate each field for each row (.csv file). JSON looks like the following:\nIn what follows, push yourself until you get stuck. I\u0026rsquo;m not interested in how far you get, but rather in how you document what you are able to do, how you look for help, how you reach out to others - or how you help others over the bumps. I know also that you all have lots of other claims on your time. Reading through all of this and making notes on what you do/don\u0026rsquo;t understand is fine too.\r Getting material out of an API Each API has its own idiosyncracies, but we can always look at the documentation and figure out how to form our requests so that our programs grab the data we\u0026rsquo;re after. The Chronicling America website from the Library of Congress has digitized American newspapers from 1789 to 1963. While the site has a fine search interface, we\u0026rsquo;ll use the API to grab every article that mentions the word \u0026lsquo;archeology\u0026rsquo; (sic).\nFirst of all, go to the Cronicling America site and search in the text box for archeology. Notice how the url changes when it brings back the results:\nhttps://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/search/pages/results/?state=\u0026amp;date1=1789\u0026amp;date2=1963\u0026amp;proxtext=archeology\u0026amp;x=0\u0026amp;y=0\u0026amp;dateFilterType=yearRange\u0026amp;rows=20\u0026amp;searchType=basic\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a lot of stuff in there - amongst other things, we can see a setting for state, for date1 and date2, our search term appears as the value for a setting called proxtext. This is the API in action.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s build.\n Open a new file in Sublime Text. We\u0026rsquo;ll first put a bit of metadata in our file, for the programme we\u0026rsquo;re going to write:  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  #!/usr/bin/env python \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; a script for getting materials from the Chronicling America website \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; # Make these modules available import requests import json __author__ = \u0026#34;your-name\u0026#34;   The first bit tells us this is a python file. The next bit tells us what the file is for. The import tells python that we\u0026rsquo;ll need a module called requests which lets us grab materials from the web, and json which helps us deal with json formatted data. The final bit says who wrote the script.\nNow we\u0026rsquo;re going to define some variables to hold the bit of the search url up to where the ? occurs - everything after the question mark are the parameters we want the API to search. We create the api_searh_url, define the parameter we want to search for, and define how we want the results returned to us. Add the following to your script:  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  # Create a variable called \u0026#39;api_search_url\u0026#39; and give it a value api_search_url = \u0026#39;https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/search/pages/results/\u0026#39; # This creates a dictionary called \u0026#39;params\u0026#39; and sets values for the API\u0026#39;s mandatory parameters params = { \u0026#39;proxtext\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;archeology\u0026#39; # Search for this keyword  } # This adds a value for \u0026#39;encoding\u0026#39; to our dictionary params[\u0026#39;format\u0026#39;] = \u0026#39;json\u0026#39;   Now we\u0026rsquo;ll send the request to the server, and we\u0026rsquo;ll add a bit of error checking so that if something is wrong, we\u0026rsquo;ll get some indication of why that is. Add this to your script:  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13  # This sends our request to the API and stores the result in a variable called \u0026#39;response\u0026#39; response = requests.get(api_search_url, params=params) # This shows us the url that\u0026#39;s sent to the API print(\u0026#39;Here\\\u0026#39;s the formatted url that gets sent to the ChronAmerca API:\\n{}\\n\u0026#39;.format(response.url)) # This checks the status code of the response to make sure there were no errors if response.status_code == requests.codes.ok: print(\u0026#39;All ok\u0026#39;) elif response.status_code == 403: print(\u0026#39;There was an authentication error. Did you paste your API above?\u0026#39;) else: print(\u0026#39;There was a problem. Error code: {}\u0026#39;.format(response.status_code))   Now let\u0026rsquo;s get the results, and put them into a variable called \u0026lsquo;data\u0026rsquo;. Then we\u0026rsquo;ll print the results to the terminal, and finish by also writing the results to a file.  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21  # Get the API\u0026#39;s JSON results and make them available as a Python variable called \u0026#39;data\u0026#39; data = response.json() # Let\u0026#39;s prettify the raw JSON data and then display it. # We\u0026#39;re using the Pygments library to add some colour to the output, so we need to import it from pygments import highlight, lexers, formatters # This uses Python\u0026#39;s JSON module to output the results as nicely indented text formatted_data = json.dumps(data, indent=2) # This colours the text highlighted_data = highlight(formatted_data, lexers.JsonLexer(), formatters.TerminalFormatter()) # And now display the results print(highlighted_data) # dump json to file with open(\u0026#39;data.json\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;w\u0026#39;) as outfile: json.dump(data, outfile)   Save your file as ca.py. Open a terminal/command prompt (remember Windows folks: anaconda powershell!) in the folder where you saved this file, and run it with:\n$ python ca.py\nYour terminal will look like it\u0026rsquo;s frozen for a few moments; that\u0026rsquo;s because your computer is reaching out to the Chronicling America website, making its request, and pulling down the results.

In essence, you need to study the website to see how they form the API, and then change up lines 13, 17 and 21 accordingly. You can see this in action for instance here, with regard to the Metropolitan Museum of Art or here, with regard to the Smithsonian. My Winter 2020 digital museums\u0026rsquo; class made APIs from collections at some of our national museums; you can see a modified version of the code to access some of their work here\nBut\u0026hellip; it\u0026rsquo;s in json format? JSON is handy for lots of computational tasks, but for you as a beginning digital historian, you might want to have the data as a table. There are a couple of options here. The easiest right now - and there\u0026rsquo;s no shame in doing this - is to use an online converter. This site: json-csv.com lets you convert your json file to csv or Excel spreadsheet, and even transfer it over to a google doc. Give that a shot right now; the text of the articles by the way is in the field \u0026lsquo;ocr_eng\u0026rsquo; which tells us that the text was originally transcribed from the images using object character recognition - so there will be errors and weird glitches in the text. Fortunately, there\u0026rsquo;s also a URL with the direct link to the original document, so you can check things for yourself.\nGLAM Workbench \u0026lsquo;GLAM\u0026rsquo; stands for \u0026lsquo;galleries, libraries, archives, and museums\u0026rsquo;. The GLAM Workbench is by Tim Sherratt, a digital historian in Australia. I would strongly recommend that you explore and give the Workbench a whirl if you are at all interested in the kinds of work that you might be able to do when you are computationally able to treat collections as data. For a glimpse as to what that might mean, check out this presentation.\n","description":"instructions","id":16,"section":"week","tags":null,"title":"APIs","uri":"https://craftingdh.netlify.com/week/2/apis/"},{"content":"Zotero is a piece of software for managing your research.

We haven\u0026rsquo;t looked at the content of those letters, but the shape of network — the meta data of that correspondence — can be revealing (remember Paul Revere!) When we stitch that together into a network of people connected because they exchanged letters, we end up with a shard of their social network. Networks can be queried for things like power, position, and role, and so used judiciously, we can begin to suss something of the social structures in which their history took place. I would recommend that you also take a long look at Scott Weingart\u0026rsquo;s series, Networks Demystified.\nIf you had trouble with the regex and didn\u0026rsquo;t quite get Open Refine to work, that\u0026rsquo;s ok. You can use this file for this gentle introduction to networks. Right-click and save-as that link.\r When Not To Use Networks Networks analysis can be a powerful method for engaging with a historical dataset but it is often not the most appropriate. Any historical database may be represented as a network with enough contriving but few should be. One could take the Atlantic trade network, including cities, ships, relevant governments and corporations, and connect them all together in a giant multipartite network. It would be extremely difficult to derive any meaning from this network, especially using traditional network analysis methodologies. Clustering coefficients (a useful network metric), for example, would be meaningless in this situation, as it would be impossible for the neighbors of any one node to be neighbors with one another. Network scientists have developed algorithms for multimodal networks, but they are often created for fairly specific purposes, and one should be very careful before applying them to a different dataset and using that analysis to explore a historiographical question.\nNetworks, as they are commonly encoded, also suffer from a profound lack of nuance. It is all well to say that, because Henry Oldenburg corresponded with both Gottfried Leibniz and John Milton, he was the short connection between the two men. However, the encoded network holds no information of whether Oldenburg actually transferred information between the two or whether that connection was at all meaningful. In a flight network, Las Vegas and Atlanta might both have very high betweenness centrality because people from many other cities fly to or from those airports, and yet one is much more of a hub than the other. This is because, largely, people tend to fly directly back and forth from Las Vegas, rather than through it, whereas people tend to fly through Atlanta from one city to another. This is the type of information that network analysis, as it is currently used, is not well equipped to handle. Whether this shortcoming affects a historical inquiry depends primarily on the inquiry itself.\nWhen deciding whether to use networks to explore a historiographical question, the first question should be: to what extent is connectivity specifically important to this research project? The next should be: can any of the network analyses my collaborators or I know how to employ be specifically useful in the research project? If either answer is negative, another approach is probably warranted.\nDatabasic.io At Databasic.io there are simple web-tools to help you see some large-scale patterns in your information. Let\u0026rsquo;s use Connect the Dots which is a simple network visualizer and analyzer - it will find communities of nodes (dots; people, in our data) and it will give us two network metrics for each node - the degree (number of connections it has) and the centrality (here, imagined as being a person who is on lots of paths connecting all other pairs).\n Go to [Connect the Dots](https://databasic.io/en/connectthedots/#upload and upload your Texas Correspondence file. Make sure it has a first row with source,target and that there are no spaces on either side of that comma, eg:  source,target Sam Houston,J. Pinckney Henderson James Webb,Alc6e La Branche\nBoom! A network visualization! What do you observe? (Scroll down to the \u0026lsquo;so what?').  More complex visualizatons and analysis Connect the dots is pretty basic. If you want to do more complex network visualizations and analysis, you can try Gephi:\n Download and install Gephi. Open Gephi by double-clicking its icon. Click \u0026ldquo;New project\u0026rdquo;. The middle pane of the interface window is the “Data Laboratory,” where you can interact with your network data in spreadsheet format. This is where we can import the data cleaned up in Open Refine. In the Data Laboratory, select “Import Spreadsheet.” Press the ellipsis ... and locate the CSV you created. Make sure that the Separator is listed as Comma and the As table is listed as Edges table. Press Next then Finish. Your data should load up. Click on the \u0026ldquo;Overview” tab and you will be presented with a tangled network graph.  Navigating Gephi Gephi is broken up into three panes: Overview, Data Laboratory, and Preview.\n The Overview pane is used to manipulate the visual properties of the network: change colors of nodes or edges, lay them out in different ways, and so forth. The Overview pane is also where you can apply algorithms to the network, like those you learned about in the previous chapter. The Data Laboratory is for adding, manipulating, and removing data. Use the Preview pane to do some final tweaks on the look and feel of the network and to export an image for publication.  There is one tweak that needs to done in the Data Table before the dataset is fully ready to be explored in Gephi.\n Click on the Data Laboratory tab. Click on the “Nodes” tab in the Data Table (this should be open already) and notice that, of the three columns, “Label” (the furthermost field on the right) is blank in every row. This will be a problem when viewing the network visualization, as those labels are essential for the network to be meaningful. In the “Nodes” tab, click “Copy data to other column” at the bottom, select “ID”, and press “Ok”. Upon doing so, the “Label” column will be filled with the appropriate labels for each correspondent. While you’re still in the Data Laboratory, look in the “Edges” tab and notice there is a “Weight” column. Gephi automatically counted every time a letter was sent from correspondent A to correspondent B and summed up all the occurrences, resulting in the “Weight.” This means that J. Pinckney Henderson sent three letters to James Webb, because Henderson is in the “Source” column, Webb in the “Target”, and the “Weight” is three. Clicking on the Overview pane will take you to a visual representation of the network you just imported. In the middle of the screen, you will see your network in the “Graph” tab. The “Context” tab, at the top right, will show that you imported 234 nodes and 394 edges. At first, all the nodes will be randomly strewn across the screen and make little visual sense.  There is a video from an earlier iteration of the course here walking through these steps. Make sure to turn on the closed captions).\n Fix the nodes by selecting a layout in the “Layout” tab – the best one for beginners is “Force Atlas 2.”\n  Press the “Run” button and watch the nodes and edges reorganize on the screen into something slightly more manageable. After the layout runs for a few minutes, re-press the button (now labeled “Stop”) to settle the nodes in their place.\n  You just ran a force-directed layout. Each dot is a correspondent in the network, and lines between dots represent letters sent between individuals. Thicker lines represent more letters, and arrows represent the direction the letters were sent, such that there may be up to two lines connecting any two correspondents (one for each direction).\nAbout two-dozen smaller components of the network will appear to shoot off into the distance, unconnected from the large, connected component in the middle. For the purpose of this exercise, we are not interested in those disconnected components, so the next step will be to filter them out of the network.\n The first step is to calculate which components of the network are connected to which others; do this by clicking “Run” next to the text that says “Connected Components” in the “Statistics” tab on the right side.\n  Once there, select “UnDirected” and press “OK.”\n  Press “Close” when the report pops up indicating that the algorithm has finished running. Now that this is done, Gephi knows which is the giant connected component and has labeled that component “0”.\n  To filter out everything but the giant component, click on the “Filters” tab on the right side and browse to \u0026ldquo;Component ID Integer (Node)\u0026rdquo; in the folder directory (you’ll find it under \u0026ldquo;Attributes,\u0026rdquo; then \u0026ldquo;Equal\u0026rdquo;).\n  Double-click \u0026ldquo;Component ID Integer (Node)\u0026rdquo; and click the \u0026ldquo;Filter\u0026rdquo; button at the bottom. Doing this removes the disconnected bundles of nodes.\n  There are many possible algorithms you could use for the analysis step, but in this case you will use the PageRank of each node in the network. This measurement calculates the prestige of a correspondent according to how often others write to him or her. The process is circular, such that correspondents with high prestige will confer their prestige on those they write to, who in turn pass their prestige along to their own correspondents. For the moment let us take its results to equate with a correspondent’s importance in the Republic of Texas letter network.\n Calculate the PageRank by clicking on the \u0026ldquo;Run\u0026rdquo; button next to \u0026ldquo;PageRank\u0026rdquo; in the \u0026ldquo;Statistics\u0026rdquo; tab. You will be presented with a prompt asking for a few parameters; make sure \u0026ldquo;Directed\u0026rdquo; network is selected and that the algorithm is taking edge weight into account (by selecting \u0026ldquo;Use edge weight\u0026rdquo;). Leave all other parameters at their default.\n  Press \u0026ldquo;OK\u0026rdquo;.\n  Once PageRank is calculated, if you click back into the \u0026ldquo;Data Laboratory\u0026rdquo; and select the \u0026ldquo;Nodes\u0026rdquo; list in the Data Table, you can see that a new \u0026ldquo;PageRank\u0026rdquo; column has been added, with values for every node. The higher the PageRank, the more central a correspondent is in the network.\n  There is a video from an earlier iteration of the course here walking through these steps. Make sure to turn on the closed captions. You probably are sick of the music, so mute that.\n Going back to the Overview pane, you can visualize this centrality by changing the size of each correspondent’s node based on its PageRank. Do this in the \u0026ldquo;Ranking\u0026rdquo; tab on the left side of the Overview pane.\n  Make sure \u0026ldquo;Nodes\u0026rdquo; is selected, press the icon of a little red diamond, and select PageRank from the drop-down menu.\n  In the parameter options just below, enter the \u0026ldquo;Min size\u0026rdquo; as 1 and the \u0026ldquo;Max size\u0026rdquo; as 10.\n  Press \u0026ldquo;Apply,\u0026rdquo; and watch the nodes resize based on their PageRank.\n  To be on the safe side and decrease clutter, re-run the \u0026ldquo;Force Atlas 2\u0026rdquo; layout as described above, making sure to keep the \u0026ldquo;Prevent Overlap\u0026rdquo; box checked.\n  Another video here covering these last few steps. I\u0026rsquo;m really sorry about the music.\nAt this point, the network is processed enough to visualize in the Preview pane, to finally begin making sense of the data.\n In Preview, on the left side, select \u0026ldquo;Show Labels,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Proportional Size,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Rescale Weight,\u0026rdquo; and deselect \u0026ldquo;Curved\u0026rdquo; edges.\n  Press \u0026ldquo;Refresh.\u0026rdquo;\n  Phew. Save your work. Gephi saves as .gephi file, but you can also export to other common formats like .gexf\nSo what? So what have we got?\nThe visualization immediately reveals apparent structure: central figures on the top (Ashbel Smith and Anson Jones) and bottom (Mirabeau B. Lamar, James Webb, and James Treat), and two central figures who connect the two split communities (James Hamilton and James S. Mayfield). A quick search online shows the top network to be associated with the last president of the Republic of Texas, Anson Jones; whereas the bottom network largely revolves around the second president, Mirabeau Lamar. Experts on this period in history could use this analysis to understand the structure of communities building to the annexation of Texas or they could ask meta-questions about the nature of the data themselves. For example, why is Sam Houston, the first and third president of the Republic of Texas, barely visible in this network?\n","description":"Basic Tools","id":18,"section":"week","tags":null,"title":"Networks","uri":"https://craftingdh.netlify.com/week/3/networks/"},{"content":"use the new stuff? throw some tf-idf in here\n","description":"Of Macroscopes and Microscopes","id":19,"section":"week","tags":null,"title":"Topic Models","uri":"https://craftingdh.netlify.com/week/4/topic-models/"},{"content":" academic posters infographics  colour theory, layout, stuff from macroscope re scott chapter\n","description":"Telling the Compelling Story","id":20,"section":"week","tags":null,"title":"Infographics","uri":"https://craftingdh.netlify.com/week/5/infographics/"},{"content":"What is Discord?

The technique was developed against clean type-written pages where the letters were crisply made. On historical documents, things can get pretty hit-and-miss. When we searched the Chronicling America website, we were actually searching the OCR\u0026rsquo;d text that was embedded in each of those pdfs (if you can select text in a pdf, it has a hidden text layer on top of the image. If you can\u0026rsquo;t, it\u0026rsquo;s just an image). We probably missed a lot of information because we searched for \u0026lsquo;archeology\u0026rsquo; but it\u0026rsquo;s entirely possible the word got transcribed as \u0026lsquo;arc50log\u0026rsquo; or other similar mismashes. Just because you searched, didn\u0026rsquo;t mean you found what was there!\nIn this walk through, we\u0026rsquo;re going to use the R language to run some images through the OCR process. I am not teaching you R, but rather, giving you two recipes that you can use.\nIn what follows, push yourself until you get stuck. I\u0026rsquo;m not interested in how far you get, but rather in how you document what you are able to do, how you look for help, how you reach out to others - or how you help others over the bumps. I know also that you all have lots of other claims on your time. Reading through all of this and making notes on what you do/don\u0026rsquo;t understand is fine too.\r One file at a time  Open Anaconda Navigator, and hit the \u0026lsquo;Install R Studio\u0026rsquo; button.\n Launch R Studio\n RStudio has within it a console, a script editor, a file explorer, and lots of other features. Click on the new button to make a new R Script.\n  We are going to OCR this image, from the 14th Canadian General Hospital war diaries:\n Right-click on that image, \u0026lsquo;save-as\u0026rsquo;, and save it somewhere sensible on your computer.\n  Using the file explorer in R Studio, navigate to where you saved that file.\n  Make that folder your \u0026lsquo;working directory\u0026rsquo;; you can do this by clicking on the \u0026lsquo;More\u0026rsquo; button beside the cogwheel. When you do this, the actual R command that achieves this will also copy into the console. R Studio now knows where to look for files, and where to save them.\n  In the script window, paste the following lines:  1 2 3  # install only the first time install.packages(\u0026#39;magick\u0026#39;) install.packages(\u0026#39;tesseract\u0026#39;)   We\u0026rsquo;ll only run these lines once, because once we\u0026rsquo;ve installed these bits of lego, we won\u0026rsquo;t have to install them again; they\u0026rsquo;ll always be available for use. Highlight all of them with your cursor, and hit the \u0026lsquo;run\u0026rsquo; button at the top of the window. Running the lines passes them to the console where they are executed; you\u0026rsquo;ll see a bunch of information scroll by as they install. Then, when it\u0026rsquo;s finished, you\u0026rsquo;ll see the \u0026gt; prompt again.\nAdd to your script these lines:  1 2 3 4  # tell R which packages you need library(magick) library(magrittr) library(tesseract)   And run them. Down in the console, nothing much should happen, but you should get the \u0026gt; again.\nAnd now let\u0026rsquo;s ocr some text. Add these lines to your script:  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13  # now let\u0026#39;s create a variable called \u0026#39;text\u0026#39; # and read the image into it # and we\u0026#39;ll modify the image to give us # the best chance of reading the text # the final line, image_ocr() does the text extraction # remember to set your working directory to whatever folder # contains the stuff you want to work on. text \u0026lt;- image_read(\u0026#34;e001518030.jpg\u0026#34;) %\u0026gt;% image_resize(\u0026#34;2000\u0026#34;) %\u0026gt;% image_convert(colorspace = \u0026#39;gray\u0026#39;) %\u0026gt;% image_trim() %\u0026gt;% image_ocr()   If you put your cursor at the \u0026lsquo;t\u0026rsquo; in \u0026lsquo;text\u0026rsquo;, and hit \u0026lsquo;run\u0026rsquo;, R Studio knows that all of these lines are joined by the %\u0026gt;% function, or pipe, and so will run everything in order to the final command, image_ocr().\nYou know it ran, because it passed the commands to the console, and you got the command prompt back.\nFinally, let\u0026rsquo;s see what we\u0026rsquo;ve got! Add the following line:  write.table(text, \u0026quot;output.txt\u0026quot;)\nand run it.\nSave your R script as \u0026ldquo;one-image-ocr.R\u0026rdquo;.\nLooping over many files at once  Grab a handful of images from the war diary and save them inside the folder you are working in, in a new subfolder (three or four are fine; I just right-clicked and save image on the urls at http://data2.archives.ca/e/e061/e001518034.jpg http://data2.archives.ca/e/e061/e001518035.jpg etc for the purposes of this recipe).  Now, we\u0026rsquo;re going to modify the first recipe to include a loop, and to apply the image modifications and to do the ocr to each image in turn. Make a new script, and then put into it which libraries you\u0026rsquo;re going to use. Run those lines.  1 2 3 4  # tell R which packages you need library(magick) library(magrittr) library(tesseract)   I put the files I wanted to work on into a subfolder called \u0026lsquo;many-pics\u0026rsquo;. Now we create a variable called \u0026lsquo;myfiles\u0026rsquo; into which we\u0026rsquo;re going to put the list of files held in our directory of files.  1 2  imgsource \u0026lt;- \u0026#34;many-pics\u0026#34; myfiles \u0026lt;- list.files(path = imgsource, pattern = \u0026#34;jpg\u0026#34;, full.names = TRUE)   Put these lines into your script, then run them. Over in the environment pane, you\u0026rsquo;ll see them get created, and you\u0026rsquo;ll see what\u0026rsquo;s inside them.\nNow the loop. Copy this into your script:  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  lapply(myfiles, function(i){ text \u0026lt;- image_read(i) %\u0026gt;% image_resize(\u0026#34;3000x\u0026#34;) %\u0026gt;% image_convert(type = \u0026#39;Grayscale\u0026#39;) %\u0026gt;% image_trim(fuzz = 40) %\u0026gt;% image_write(format = \u0026#39;png\u0026#39;, density = \u0026#39;300x300\u0026#39;) %\u0026gt;% tesseract::ocr() outfile \u0026lt;- paste(i,\u0026#34;-ocr.txt\u0026#34;,sep=\u0026#34;\u0026#34;) cat(text, file=outfile, sep=\u0026#34;\\n\u0026#34;)   Techically, this isn\u0026rsquo;t actually a loop. We\u0026rsquo;re just applying all of this image fixing and text extraction to each file in our myfiles variable, and then creating a unique text file appending -ocr.txt to the original filename. Put the cursor at the l in lapply, and then hit run; the machine will take some time to do its thing, but then\u0026hellip;\nNow imagine how much you\u0026rsquo;re missing when you do keyword searches of OCR\u0026rsquo;d documents\u0026hellip;\nSave your work.\nWhat about handwriting?

The value of network analysis comes from the various questions we can now start posing of our data when it is represented as a network. In this correspondence network, who is in the centre of the web? To whom would information flow? To whom would information leak? Are there cliques or ingroups? When we identify such individuals, how does that confirm or confound our expectations of the period and place? Many different kinds of metrics can be calculated (and the [Kateto R igraph tutorial](https://kateto.net/networks-r-igraph) will show you how) but it\u0026#39;s always worth remembering that a metric is only meaningful for a given network when we\u0026#39;re dealing with similar things — a network of people who write letters to one another; a network of banks that swap mortgages with one another. These are called \u0026#39;one mode networks\u0026#39;. A network of people connected to the banks they use — a two mode network, because it connects two different kinds of things — might be useful to visualize but the metrics calculated might not be valid if the metric was designed to work on a one-mode network . Given our correspondence network, let\u0026#39;s imagine that \u0026#39;closeness\u0026#39; (a measure of how central a person is) and \u0026#39;betweenness\u0026#39; (a measure of how many different strands of the network pass through this person) are the most historically interesting. Further, we\u0026#39;re going to try to determine if there are subgroups in our network, cliques. ```R ## the \u0026#39;degree\u0026#39; of a node is the count of its connections. In this code chunk, we calculate degree, then make both a histogram of the counts and a plot of the network where we size the nodes proportionately to their degree. What do we learn from these two visualizations? deg \u0026lt;- degree(net, mode=\u0026#34;all\u0026#34;) hist(deg, breaks=1:vcount(net)-1, main=\u0026#34;Histogram of node degree\u0026#34;) plot(net, vertex.size=deg*2, vertex.label = NA) ## write this info to file for safekeeping write.csv(deg, \u0026#39;degree.csv\u0026#39;)   Now we\u0026rsquo;ll look at closeness. If you know the width or diameter of your network (the maximum number of steps to get across it), then the node that is on average the shortest number of steps from all the others is the one that is closest. We calculate it like the following:\n1 2 3  closepeople \u0026lt;- closeness(net, mode=\u0026#34;all\u0026#34;, weights=NA) sort(closepeople, decreasing = T) # so that we see who is most close first write.csv(closepeople, \u0026#39;closeness.csv\u0026#39;) # so we have it on file.   We can ask which individuals are hubs, and which are authorities. In the lingo, \u0026lsquo;hubs\u0026rsquo; are individuals with many outgoing links (they sent lots of letters) while \u0026lsquo;authorities\u0026rsquo; are individuals who received lots of letters. In the code below, can you work out what command to give to write the hub score or the authority scores to a file?\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  hs \u0026lt;- hub_score(net, weights=NA)$vector as \u0026lt;- authority_score(net, weights=NA)$vector par(mfrow=c(1,2)) # vertex.label.cex sets the size of the label; play with the sizes until you see something appealing. plot(net, vertex.size=hs*40, vertex.label.cex =.2, edge.arrow.size=.1, main=\u0026#34;Hubs\u0026#34;) plot(net, vertex.size=as*20, vertex.label = NA, edge.arrow.size=.1, main=\u0026#34;Authorities\u0026#34;)   Let\u0026rsquo;s look for \u0026lsquo;modules\u0026rsquo; within this network. Broadly speaking, these are clumps of nodes that have more or less the same pattern of ties between them, within the group, than without.\n1 2 3  cfg \u0026lt;- cluster_fast_greedy(as.undirected(net)) lapply(cfg, function(x) write.table( data.frame(x), \u0026#39;cfg.csv\u0026#39; , append= T, sep=\u0026#39;,\u0026#39; ))   We create a new variable called cfg and get the cluster_fast_greedy algorithm to perform its calculations. The next line writes the groups to a file, separating each group with an x. (If you tried write.csv as before, you\u0026rsquo;ll get an error message because the output of the algorithm gives a different kind of data type. R is fussy like this.) Examine that file — what groups do you spot? What might these mean, if you went back to the content of the original letters?\nThe line below will plot out our network, colouring it by the communities discerned above, like the following:\n1  plot(cfg, net, vertex.size = 1, vertex.label.cex =.2, edge.arrow.size=.1, main=\u0026#34;Communities\u0026#34;)   You can export the plot by clicking on the \u0026lsquo;Export\u0026rsquo; button in the plot panel, to PDF or to PNG. But this is a pretty ugly network. We need to apply a layout to try to make it more visually understandable. There are many different layout options in igraph. We\u0026rsquo;ll assign the layout we want to a variable, and then we\u0026rsquo;ll give that variable to the plot command like the following:\n1 2 3  l1 \u0026lt;- layout_with_fr(net) plot(cfg, net, layout=l1, vertex.size = 1, vertex.label.cex =.2, edge.arrow.size=.1, main=\u0026#34;Communities\u0026#34;)   The layout_with_fr is calling the \u0026lsquo;Fruchterman-Reingold\u0026rsquo; algorithm, a kind of layout that imagines each node as a repulsive power, pushing against all the other nodes (it\u0026rsquo;s part of a family of layouts called \u0026lsquo;Forced Atlas\u0026rsquo;). That also means that if you ran the plot command a couple of times, the nodes might end up in different places each time — they are jostling for relative position, and this positioning itself carries no meaning in and of itself (so if a node is at the top of the screen, or the centre of the screen, don\u0026rsquo;t read that to mean anything about importance).\nGood luck!

We do not use cuLearn in the course. We work on the open web instead. Successful completion of this class involves doing a series of exercises each week designed to push you out of your comfort zone, AND to be a collegial and generous scholar engaging with, and helping your peers to achieve success. What is challenging for one student will not necessarily be challenging for another, and I expect you to push yourself and pull others along as you go. Thus open and honest reporting of what works and what hasn’t worked, is a meaningful aspect of this course. You don’t need to be techy to succeed, but you do need to be willing to embrace when things go ‘wrong’.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s super important that you try to complete the weekly exercises each week before moving onwards. Each week builds on the previous week\u0026rsquo;s work. In my experience, trying to complete this course in a compressed time frame is extremely difficult. Stay on task, complete one module a week. Work that is completed by the end of the week can expect formative feedback from me by the middle of the subsequent week. I prioritize responding to recent work, rather than overdue work. There is no grade penalty for overdue work, but you will miss out on feedback.\nThis course aims to change how you think about, and think with, digitized resources and digital tools. I am not trying to turn you into a coder. Rather, I am trying to turn you into a historian who is thoughtful and reflective about the ways digital tools transform what it is we know about the past and how we come to know it.\n","description":"what to tell your friends","id":26,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"1. Course Description","uri":"https://craftingdh.netlify.com/docs/1-coursedescription/"},{"content":"Outcomes  This course will enable you to analyze and assess historical documents, artifacts, and other primary sources through the lens of digital history methods, critically applied, and you will develop awareness of the ways digital tools change what it is possible to know about the past. At the same time, this ability will enable you to analyze and assess critically digital tools and methods from a historical perspective. Given that this is an online course, another outcome will be your ability to conduct such research independently. However, no one operates in a vacuum; digital historians collaborate to troubleshoot or develop technologies, and through open practices to data sharing and reuse, learn to build upon each others\u0026rsquo; work in a collaborative fashion. Another outcome will be the ability to translate the results of digital methods into historical argument. Digital work is often necessarily therefore a kind of public work, and a final outcome therefore will be a professionalized presence online.  Texts See the weekly work section. All readings are open access.\nReal Names Policy You do not need to use your real name or identity on any public-facing work that you do in this course. Nor do you need to explain to me that you wish to use a pseudonym. It is sufficient that you send an email to me with the following message:\n‘I would like to use the following username in all public-facing work: xxxxxxxx’\n…where xxxxx is the name you have selected. For safety’s sake, if you decide to use a pseudonym, do not use one that you have used on any other website or social media platform.\nWhen Life Intervenes There\u0026rsquo;s nothing we can\u0026rsquo;t roll with, in this class. That said, it is a compressed time frame: so if something comes up, just let me know:\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t have to share the details with me. It is enough for me to know that something has intervened. I trust you.\r When something comes up and this course has to move to the backburner, contact me and we can figure out something else to do, or something else that will help you be successful here. It\u0026rsquo;s our course - we can change things up as we need to.\n","description":"what you'll get out of this course","id":27,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"2.

Course Calendar","uri":"https://craftingdh.netlify.com/docs/3-schedule/"},{"content":"There is no midterm. There is no final exam.\r Weekly Exercises Each week, there are set exercises for you to attempt.\nWeekly work should be completed by the end of the relevant week.\nI am not looking for \u0026lsquo;correct\u0026rsquo; completion, or that you powered through x amount of them. I am, rather, looking for your evidence of thinking through the meaning of the process: what worked, what didn\u0026rsquo;t, why, and what that might mean for you as a historian. I am looking for you to tie your process explicitly to the readings. I am looking to see if the conversations you have with me or your peers (or indeed elsewhere on the web or in other courses) are causing you to reflect on the what/why/how/ of what you do.\nEvidence Therefore, I am looking for the following kinds of evidence (each week will specify what needs to be done):\n logs that keep track of what you actually tried reflection on that process engagement with the materials and your classmates (which might be demonstrated many different ways) evidence for your growth as a historian over this course  At the end of each week, you will provide to me through a form that can be found on each weekly page the links to your evidence for me to consider, by Sunday evening.\nI will return feedback to you within two or three days. I will write you a note giving you my perspective on what you\u0026rsquo;ve done (using the lens of the learning outcomes), and offering advice. Your weekly work will be assessed as \u0026lsquo;satisfactory\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;unsatisfactory\u0026rsquo;.\nThis feedback will also be mapped against the learning outcomes, so that you know how you are progressing throughout the course.\nThe Exit Ticket You will produce an \u0026lsquo;exit ticket\u0026rsquo; for me at the end of the course (open format) reflecting on where you started and where you\u0026rsquo;ve gotten to, and you will indicate how you feel you\u0026rsquo;ve done against the learning outcomes. The exit ticket is a summary assessment exercise that will pull all the different strings together into a strong cord. Everyone\u0026rsquo;s journey is different. Digital methods are more a matter of practice and time than they are of aptitude.\nYour final grade isn\u0026rsquo;t based on getting something \u0026lsquo;correct\u0026rsquo;. It\u0026rsquo;s based on your own assessment of your own journey.\r If you\u0026rsquo;ve never done digital work before, it might be that you never quite manage to get as many of the tech things working as you might\u0026rsquo;ve wanted: but you now know what you didn\u0026rsquo;t know before. That\u0026rsquo;s a win. You might be a computer science minor and the tech materials don\u0026rsquo;t present you with much challenge: but figuring out how to tell the compelling story was very difficult for you but you\u0026rsquo;re better at it now. Your \u0026lsquo;exit ticket\u0026rsquo; will explain to me your particular context, and it will point to the evidence that demonstrates how you\u0026rsquo;ve moved along from where you were at the beginning to where you are now.\nIf I agree with your assessment, then that is the grade you will receive. When I have disagreed in previous courses this has been, 9.5 times out of 10, to raise the grade: y\u0026rsquo;all are too hard on yourselves. If I have disagreed and felt that you\u0026rsquo;ve overstated things - if you were the 0.5 out of 10 - we would talk and come to an agreement.\nThe Exit Ticket should be submitted by the last day of the early summer term. If you should require more time, you need merely to let me know; no questions asked.\nGrading Remembering the learning outcomes,\n   Learning Outcome A B C D eg. Joe Q Student     1. analytical ability - - - - X   2. methodology - - - - -   3. collaboration - - - - X   4. argumentation - - - - X   5. professionalization - - - - -    \u0026hellip;5/5 would be an A, 4/5 would be a B, 3/5 would be a C, 2/5 a D.\nIn this example, based on my consideration of Joe Q Student\u0026rsquo;s evidence and the feedback I\u0026rsquo;d written him over the six weeks, it seemed to me that he did what he needed to do (satisfactorily) for 3 out of the 5 outcomes and so earned a C. However, his exit ticket might bring him up. Percentage Breakdown I am required by the University to provide a percentage breakdown.\nWeekly work = 80%\nFinal Exit ticket = 20%\nI reserve the right to adjust those percentages to take into account the particular circumstances of the student.\n","description":"grading and ungrading","id":29,"section":"docs","tags":null,"title":"4.

Contacting Dr. Graham","uri":"https://craftingdh.netlify.com/docs/6-contact/"},{"content":"This course originally was a face-to-face class, over 13 weeks. That let us get into the nitty-gritty of different approaches and platforms; it gave us the opportunity to have guest speakers; and most importantly, it gave us the time to really grapple with different kinds of historical \u0026lsquo;capta\u0026rsquo; (see Drucker on \u0026lsquo;capta versus data\u0026rsquo;). But, needs evolved and eventually the course moved fully online. Now only 6 weeks long, a lot of things have been cut, compressed, or rethought entirely. I do not aim for coverage. Rather, I am trying to help you learn the skills that you will need to uncover whatever aspect of digital history method and thought that will help you with your research goals. A big part of that is trying to teach how to deal with what might feel like \u0026lsquo;failure\u0026rsquo;, on first blush.\nSocial Contact Another problem with moving fully online was the isolation. Working with digital tools, especially when you\u0026rsquo;re not overly familiar with how they work - or even the underlying metaphors that would help you make sense of what\u0026rsquo;s going on - is frustrating. Bad enough when you have classmates you see twice a week and can at least complain with over coffee later; extremely awful when you\u0026rsquo;re on a bad internet connection and everyone thinks that you\u0026rsquo;re not really doing schoolwork.\nInitially, I used Slack as a way of trying to meet that need for human connection that makes learning meaningful. It worked, more or less, but if there was a conversation going on and you missed part of it, it could just feel overwhelming and impenetrable.\nAnd it was one more damned thing to install. One more damned thing to get a password for.\nI tried Zulipchat another year. Same problem again.\nThis year, as I write this, I\u0026rsquo;m trying Discord, for its voice and screensharing integration. We\u0026rsquo;ll see how that goes.\nThe Workbook I put all of the materials for the course into an online workbook, built from text files that used markdown conventions to indicate headings, links, images and so on. The website for the workbook would then be generated using mkdocs, a python library for generating static websites. It worked, but over the years I kept adding more and more to it, links would get broken or websites would go offline\u0026hellip; it was a lot of work to prune it, keep it up to date.\nAnd then COVID-19 happened.\nI normally have a lot of time to rethink what needs taught, to prune what has become useless, to add newer resources, newer thinking. But this time around, not so much. I put the older version of the course away, and started trying to build what I thought were the most useful elements: given everything else that is going on, what are the key things I think you ought to do in order to plant the seeds of your eventual engagement with digital history?\nThe result is this present website, which combines a number of features of the course that were previously spread across a number of locations. I have also pared down to a more limited number of skill-based exercises so that you have more time to think about the context (historiographical, theoretical) of their potential use. I offer more direction and less freedom-to-choose in terms of the work I think that needs to be done, but the trade off here is that you are more able to share what you are doing with your peers and to find help.\nWhich reminds me:\nDigital History is a team sport. You are never expected to power through all of this material on your own in heroic scholarly endeavor. If you need help, ask for help; if you can help, offer it. You are not alone.\r This website is built using Hugo, a static site builder. Static sites are quicker, more secure, and separate content from container, thus making them more sustainable. I write all of the content in individual text files, which I can then turn into whatever output - html, pdf, word doc - that I need. My writing is freed from subscription-based software that might lock it in. I push all of the text files onto github (you can see them here.) Then, I have netlify.com watch those files for any changes. When it spots changes, it uses Hugo to turn them into html, and serves them up at craftingdh.netlify.com.\nSome of the work we do requires working with the command line or the terminal of your computer; I also provide a virtual computer that you can access through your browser so that you don\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about configuring your particular machine to do any one task. This also allows me to write instructions once, and know that everyone will be able to do it (there are always differences between Mac and PC that trip us up). The virtual computer is provided by a service called Binder; I set up a folder on Github with the required bits-and-pieces (think of them as lego blocks) that are necessary for a particular task. I then point Binder at that folder, and it spins up a virtual computer with those pieces properly installed. It then gives me a URL that I can share with you - link on it, and boom! a computer in the cloud ready to go.\nAll of this is now under the \u0026lsquo;weekly work\u0026rsquo; part of this site. Take your time, annotate the parts that are confusing or troublesome with hypothes.is and you\u0026rsquo;ll do well.\nOne last thing I asked Twitter for its thoughts, as you do:\n.twitter-tweet { font: 14px/1.45 -apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,\"Segoe UI\",Roboto,Oxygen-Sans,Ubuntu,Cantarell,\"Helvetica Neue\",sans-serif; border-left: 4px solid #2b7bb9; padding-left: 1.5em; color: #555; } .twitter-tweet a { color: #2b7bb9; text-decoration: none; } blockquote.twitter-tweet a:hover, blockquote.twitter-tweet a:focus { text-decoration: underline; }  5 top [method/skills] things students new to digital history should learn.

Colophon","uri":"https://craftingdh.netlify.com/docs/7-colophon/"},{"content":"Help! Things have gone wrong! Montparnasse Derailment, 1895\nThings are going to go wrong. Things are going to break. Instructions will seem vague or incomplete - or worse, I will have indeed forgotten to tell you something crucial.\nOr worse, I\u0026rsquo;ve made an assumption about your understanding, and left things unsaid that needed to be made explicit. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of this, in the digital world, in fact.\nThis week, you learned a bit about Git and Github. Let\u0026rsquo;s look at a question on the q-and-a site, \u0026lsquo;Stackoverflow\u0026rsquo; here. Just scroll through that question, and look at some of the answers. Make a note of any terms or code or responses that make not an ounce of sense to you.\nIt can make you feel rather overwhelmed, rather quickly. And like most places on the internet, StackOverflow has its own culture, its own norms of expression and behaviour. People who are new can get roasted. That\u0026rsquo;s one of the reasons we have our own discord server, and a private reading group on Hypothesis: these are places for you to ask for help from a community that understands where you\u0026rsquo;re coming from because we\u0026rsquo;re all in the same headspace.\nSo, when things go wrong, the first thing to do is to find the community that understands where you\u0026rsquo;re coming from. I read and search StackOverflow all the time, but I rarely ask questions there. Instead, I write to trusted colleagues. And they in turn write to me.\nBut there are a couple of things we can do to make life easier.\nAsking good questions StackOverflow does have good advice on asking good questions. I will excerpt some of their advice:\n Write a title that summarizes the specific problem\u0026hellip; If you\u0026rsquo;re having trouble summarizing the problem, write the title last - sometimes writing the rest of the question first can make it easier to describe the problem.\n  Introduce the problem before you post any code [or a screenshot or a video clip]\u0026hellip;start by expanding on the summary you put in the title. Explain how you encountered the problem you\u0026rsquo;re trying to solve, and any difficulties that have prevented you from solving it yourself.\n  Help others reproduce the problem [SG: post the code, post a screenshot, post a video clip walk through]\n Please do this.\nEvery term, I receive dozens of emails with the subject line \u0026lsquo;help\u0026rsquo; and the message body \u0026lsquo;i tried it and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work\u0026rsquo;. Sometimes, the message will also say \u0026lsquo;i worked on it for 3 hrs and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work\u0026rsquo;.\nNone of that is helpful. Telling me that you worked on it for 3 hours just shows me that you ignored my messages about \u0026lsquo;if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t come after 30 minutes, take a break, ask for help\u0026rsquo;. So - let\u0026rsquo;s practice right now.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re going to make a git mistake.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the situation:\n Imagine that you were working on your repo, wanting to update it from the command line - but you had to go away for a bit. When you come back, you discover your computer has run out of juice and shut down. Plugging it back in, none of your folders are open. You click on what you think is the right one and start to carry on\u0026hellip;.\n Right-click on any folder on your computer except the one(s) you created in the github exercise, and open a command prompt or a terminal there. Imagine I told you to commit your changes, like so: git commit -m \u0026quot;this is just a test\u0026quot;.\nDo that.\nWhat happened? Write a \u0026lsquo;help request\u0026rsquo;, using the guidelines above, and post it in the appropriate channel in our Discord, introducing it with an appropriate title (eg, \u0026lsquo;Demo Help Request\u0026rsquo;). Feel free to respond to a request with eg \u0026lsquo;Demo Help Response\u0026rsquo;.\nAnswering questions As the course progresses, you will have many opportunities to ask for help from me and from your peers - post these in our discord server in the appropriate channel.\nSometimes, you will see questions that you can answer. A few guidelines for answering questions:\n There are many different ways to solve these issues; someone might post a different way but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that either of you are necessarily wrong. Read the question carefully. Request clarification if there are bits that the original poster didn\u0026rsquo;t make clear - help them to ask better questions. Use screenshots and screenvideo (I find screencastomatic handy in this regard) to show how things worked for you. Provide links to useful relevant material if you know of it. Assume the best of everyone: not everyone has the same fluency with these machines, and it takes a while to learn the language.

Note that when you enter the password, the cursor won\u0026rsquo;t move. This is old-school security in action\u0026hellip;\n  Download and install ffmpeg.\nOn a mac - if you haven\u0026rsquo;t already, get homebrew first (a package manager for downloading and installing things like this) here. That website gives you a command to run in your terminal to download and install homebrew. (But if you successfully installed Brew when you did the wget work, then you just need to do the brew install command). Then, when homebrew is installed: brew install ffmpeg\n  On a pc: download and install from here\nNow let\u0026rsquo;s do this!  There\u0026rsquo;s a copy of the \u0026lsquo;I have a dream\u0026rsquo; speech uploaded by this user at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I47Y6VHc3Ms. Note the bit after ?v=. That\u0026rsquo;s the id of the video we\u0026rsquo;re after. There are several versions of each video on youtube, to account for the different kinds of devices and resolution and so on. We\u0026rsquo;ll use youtube-dl to examine the different versions of this video, so that we can find the smallest one. At the command prompt, type youtube-dl -F I47Y6VHc3Ms The -F (upper case!) tells youtube-dl to go grab all of the info and print it out for us. Each line is a different version of the video, and each line has a unique number id. We look for the line that tells us which version is smallest. Today, that\u0026rsquo;s line 249 (notice that it also tells you that this is just the audio only). So now we tell youtube-dl to download only that version: youtube-dl -f 249 I47Y6VHc3Ms. The -f (lower case!) flag lets us select the line number we want, and then the ID string tells youtube which video we\u0026rsquo;re after. Use your file explorer to rename the file that you just downloaded to something sensible; I changed mine to \u0026lsquo;mlk.webm\u0026rsquo;. Now we\u0026rsquo;ll convert the file to a .wav file with the ffmpeg command: ffmpeg -i mlk.webm mlk.wav Move the file into the /source folder. Now we\u0026rsquo;re ready to chop the file into 30 second increments. Here we go: ffmpeg -i source/mlk.wav -f segment -segment_time 30 -c copy parts/out%09d.wav But before we pass those to google, note that files that contain dead air or nothing that is recognizable as speech can break things. Listen to the first two or three files you just created (in your file explorer, click on them). Delete the ones that are dead air. \u0026hellip;and now pass on the remaining filesto Google for processing! Make sure you\u0026rsquo;re in the correct location (eg, the speech-to-text folder) and type python slow.py \u0026gt; results.txt  A little progress bar will appear, and your code is passing your files one at a time up to google for processing; google is sending back to you the text! When it\u0026rsquo;s done, just open up the results.txt file.\nIf you have audio from other sources you\u0026rsquo;d like to try, just follow the pattern for converting it to .wav format, place it in the correct place (\\source), clean out the \\parts subdirectory, modify the command in step 7 with your own file name, and away you\u0026rsquo;ll go!\n","description":"instructions","id":34,"section":"week","tags":null,"title":"This week's bonus","uri":"https://craftingdh.netlify.com/week/2/bonus/"},{"content":"The Last Bit Do Reflect Submit work You can submit the link to your work on this form\n","description":"Final Submission Instructions","id":35,"section":"week","tags":null,"title":"Final Submission Instructions","uri":"https://craftingdh.netlify.com/week/6-5/instructions/"},{"content":" exhibit with Wax Omeka - reclaimhosting, links to tutorials Neatline - links to tutorials  ","description":"Telling the Compelling Story","id":36,"section":"week","tags":null,"title":"This Week's Bonus","uri":"https://craftingdh.netlify.com/week/5/bonus/"},{"content":"Click title to see the full Post\nLorem est tota propiore conpellat pectoribus de\npectora summo.
