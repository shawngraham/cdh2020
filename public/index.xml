        <description>Goals for this week  learn some of the ways historical information is made available digitally, paying attention to disparities of labour, and of tech  Listen Read Something given. That&amp;rsquo;s a nice way of thinking about it. Of course, much of the data that we are &amp;lsquo;given&amp;rsquo; wasn&amp;rsquo;t really given willingly. When we topic model Martha Ballard&amp;rsquo;s diary, did she give this to us? Of course, she couldn&amp;rsquo;t have imagined what we might try to do to it.</description>

        <guid>https://craftingdh.netlify.com/week/2/installing-anaconda/</guid>
        <description>Introduction Cost = $0.
Anaconda is a platform for data science work. By installing Anaconda, you get access to a series of tools for working in both the Python and R programming languages, plus excellent visual interfaces that reduce (some of) the pain of programming.
When we do work in python, we sometimes need to add more lego-pieces to what we&amp;rsquo;re doing, to accomplish specific tasks. Anaconda comes with very nearly - but not all - of the pieces you might need.</description>

        <description>If any of the instructions below are unclear, annotate this page with hypothesis while being logged into our course reading group. If you spot someone asking for help and you can offer advice, respond to the annotation. Introduction Github is a code sharing website often used by digital historians. &amp;lsquo;Git&amp;rsquo; is a program that takes snapshots of the current state of a folder, and stores them in sequence, allowing you to revert your changes to an earlier state.</description>

        <description>Introduction A regular expression (also called regex) is a powerful tool for finding and manipulating text. At its simplest, a regular expression is just a way of looking through texts to locate patterns. When you search a website for instance (use ctrl+f in most applications to search, by the way), the search box finds exact matches; there&amp;rsquo;s no room for fuzziness. A regular expression on the other hand can help you find every line that begins with a number, or every instance of an email address, or whenever a word is used even if there are slight variations in how it&amp;rsquo;s spelled.</description>

        <description>The following combines elements of Ian Milligan&amp;rsquo;s tutorial at The Programming Historian, as well as Kellen Kurschinski&amp;rsquo;s.
Introduction Wget is a program for downloading materials from the web. It is extremely powerful: if we do it wrong we can look like an attacker, or worse, download the entire internet! We use this program on the command line. We will cover some of the basics, and then we will create a little program that uses wget to download materials from Library and Archives Canada.</description>

        <description>Sometimes, a website will have what is called an Application Programming Interface or API. In essence, this lets a program on your computer talk to the computer serving the website you&amp;rsquo;re interested in, such that the website gives you the data that you&amp;rsquo;re looking for.
An API is just a way of opening up a program so that another program can interact with it. That is, instead of an interface meant for a human to interact with the machine, there’s an API to allow some other machine to interact with this one.</description>

        <description>Zotero is a piece of software for managing your research. When it is installed, it can extract metadata from websites or pdfs (when these have metadata) and store the information in your very own library. Zotero can be connected to Word or Google Docs so that when it is time to insert a reference, you can select the reference from your library - and then get the machine to automatically format/update your bibliography against whatever citation style you use.</description>

        <description>Object Character Recognition is a technique that looks at the pattern of light and dark pixels in an image and matches them against the alphabet. The technique was developed against clean type-written pages where the letters were crisply made. On historical documents, things can get pretty hit-and-miss. When we searched the Chronicling America website, we were actually searching the OCR&amp;rsquo;d text that was embedded in each of those pdfs (if you can select text in a pdf, it has a hidden text layer on top of the image.</description>

        <description>Outcomes  This course will enable you to analyze and assess historical documents, artifacts, and other primary sources through the lens of digital history methods, critically applied, and you will develop awareness of the ways digital tools change what it is possible to know about the past. At the same time, this ability will enable you to analyze and assess critically digital tools and methods from a historical perspective. Given that this is an online course, another outcome will be your ability to conduct such research independently.</description>

        <description>There is no midterm. There is no final exam. Weekly Exercises Each week, there are set exercises for you to attempt.
Weekly work should be completed by the end of the relevant week.
I am not looking for &amp;lsquo;correct&amp;rsquo; completion, or that you powered through x amount of them. I am, rather, looking for your evidence of thinking through the meaning of the process: what worked, what didn&amp;rsquo;t, why, and what that might mean for you as a historian.</description>

        <description>The following are the University regulations common to all History courses. COPIES OF WRITTEN WORK SUBMITTED Always retain for yourself a copy of all essays, term papers, written assignments or take-home tests submitted in your courses.
PLAGIARISM The University Senate defines plagiarism as “presenting, whether intentionally or not, the ideas, expression of ideas or work of others as one’s own.” This can include:
 reproducing or paraphrasing portions of someone else’s published or unpublished material, regardless of the source, and presenting these as one’s own without proper citation or reference to the original source; submitting a take home examination, essay, laboratory report or other assignment written, in whole or in part, by someone else; using ideas or direct, verbatim quotations, or paraphrased material, concepts, or ideas without appropriate acknowledgment in any academic assignment; using another’s data or research findings; failing to acknowledge sources through the use of proper citations when using another’s works and/or failing to use quotation marks; handing in &amp;ldquo;substantially the same piece of work for academic credit more than once without prior written permission of the course instructor in which the submission occurs.</description>

        <description>This course originally was a face-to-face class, over 13 weeks. That let us get into the nitty-gritty of different approaches and platforms; it gave us the opportunity to have guest speakers; and most importantly, it gave us the time to really grapple with different kinds of historical &amp;lsquo;capta&amp;rsquo; (see Drucker on &amp;lsquo;capta versus data&amp;rsquo;). But, needs evolved and eventually the course moved fully online. Now only 6 weeks long, a lot of things have been cut, compressed, or rethought entirely.</description>

        <description>Help! Things have gone wrong! Montparnasse Derailment, 1895
Things are going to go wrong. Things are going to break. Instructions will seem vague or incomplete - or worse, I will have indeed forgotten to tell you something crucial.
Or worse, I&amp;rsquo;ve made an assumption about your understanding, and left things unsaid that needed to be made explicit. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of this, in the digital world, in fact.
This week, you learned a bit about Git and Github.</description>

        <description>Historian&amp;rsquo;s don&amp;rsquo;t deal with video very well. That is to say, we don&amp;rsquo;t have many tools for dealing with video as video, as a moving image, and analyzing with an eye towards the specific affordances of the medium (but see Arnold and Tilton&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Distant Viewing&amp;rsquo; project, and their position paper.)
But we&amp;rsquo;re good with text. In this bonus exercise, you&amp;rsquo;ll download a video from youtube of Dr. Martin Luther King&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;I have a dream&amp;rsquo; speech (wikipedia), and use Google&amp;rsquo;s speech-to-text engine to generate a time-stamped transcript of the speech.</description>
