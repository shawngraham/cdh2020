Read Something given. That&amp;rsquo;s a nice way of thinking about it. Of course, much of the data that we are &amp;lsquo;given&amp;rsquo; wasn&amp;rsquo;t really given willingly. When we topic model Martha Ballard&amp;rsquo;s diary, did she give this to us?</description>

DH Exploration Exercise Remember back in Part one, how I had you explore that twitter thread by Amalia Skarlatou Levi? In this final segment, you&amp;rsquo;ll be selecting one of those resources she shared (or, if none strike your fancy, something from the resources gathered here, or from the list of Ottawa Datasets at the bottom of the page) to do some exploratory digital history.</description>

        <description>Introduction Everyone comes to digital work with differing levels of prior familiarity with computing. You do not need to be &amp;lsquo;techy&amp;rsquo; (whatever that is), but you do need to be open to learning from things that fail. This can uncomfortable.
For all of the tutorials that you attempt, I require that you keep a log of your work. For this, you create a text file in which you keep your thoughts, the error messages, the solutions you try, the websites you go to for help, the advice you get from others, and so on.</description>

        <description>Have you ever fought with Word or another word processor, trying to get things just right? Word processing is a mess. It conflates writing with typesetting and layout. Sometimes, you just want to get the words out. Other times, you want to make your writing as accessible as possible&amp;hellip; but your intended recipient can&amp;rsquo;t open your file, because they don&amp;rsquo;t use the same word processor. Or perhaps you wrote up some great notes that you&amp;rsquo;d love to have in a slideshow; but you can&amp;rsquo;t, because copying and pasting preserves a whole lot of extra gunk that messes up your materials.</description>

        <guid>https://craftingdh.netlify.com/docs/2-learning-outcomes/</guid>
        <description>Outcomes  This course will enable you to analyze and assess historical documents, artifacts, and other primary sources through the lens of digital history methods, critically applied, and you will develop awareness of the ways digital tools change what it is possible to know about the past. At the same time, this ability will enable you to analyze and assess critically digital tools and methods from a historical perspective. Given that this is an online course, another outcome will be your ability to conduct such research independently.</description>

        <description>The six weeks of the course are divided into four parts. Each part involves completing to the best of your ability a series of exercises; you will document your progress in a log that you will keep online. Log entries are required to be completed by midnight at the end of the relevant part. Late work can be accepted only in consultation with Dr. Graham. Otherwise, late work will not be graded nor accepted.</description>

        <description>Introduction Cost = $0.
Anaconda is a platform for data science work. By installing Anaconda, you get access to a series of tools for working in both the Python and R programming languages, plus excellent visual interfaces that reduce (some of) the pain of programming.
When we do work in python, we sometimes need to add more lego-pieces to what we&amp;rsquo;re doing, to accomplish specific tasks. Anaconda comes with very nearly - but not all - of the pieces you might need.</description>

        <description>There is no midterm. There is no final exam. Repositories, logs, and reflections In each part of this course, there are things to read and reflect on, and things to do, depending on which sequence you choose to follow. Everyone&amp;rsquo;s journey is different. Digital methods are more a matter of practice and time than they are of aptitude.
You will collect all of your work together and keep track of it in an account you will create on Github.</description>

        <description>Cleaning and Manipulating Data with R We&amp;rsquo;re going to use data from pulled from the The Survey of Scottish Witchcraft Database for this tutorial; this tutorial was written by Chantal Brousseau.
So maybe you&amp;rsquo;ve created a dataset by scraping the web, or found some really cool open data but&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s messy! You try to make visuals with it, but there&amp;rsquo;s so many nonsense characters and repeating words that your data seems meaningless!</description>

        <description>I might be making a terrible assumption, but I&amp;rsquo;m assuming that many if not most of you have played around with Excel before. What follows is a very basic introduction, just in case. Library and Archives Canada provides links to historical census data, along with quite comprehensive discussion about how the material was digitized, how it was collected in the first place, and the limitations of the data.
Unfortunately, none of it is available as a simple table that we could download.</description>

        <description>The following combines elements of Ian Milligan&amp;rsquo;s tutorial at The Programming Historian, as well as Kellen Kurschinski&amp;rsquo;s.
Introduction Wget is a program for downloading materials from the web. It is extremely powerful: if we do it wrong we can look like an attacker, or worse, download the entire internet! We use this program on the command line. We will cover some of the basics, and then we will create a little program that uses wget to download materials from Library and Archives Canada.</description>

Welcome! I don&amp;rsquo;t know how you found this page, but if you did, more power to you.
Check your Carleton email account for a note from me about getting started in the class.
There are no zoom meetings in this class (balloons, confetti, streamers fall from ceiling, much rejoicing, etc).
There is a discord server for a class social space and for video, audio chat &amp;amp; screensharing (which is useful when things go wrong and you want someone to look at what you&amp;rsquo;re doing).</description>

        <description>Simple Versioning with Git &amp;amp; Github Git is a program you can put on your computer to take periodic &amp;lsquo;snapshots&amp;rsquo; or commits of the contents of your folder. Each snapshot gets a descriptive message about why you&amp;rsquo;ve taken that snapshot. Git can also let you create &amp;lsquo;branches&amp;rsquo; for your work from a given point. You might want to do an experiment; a branch is a copy of your folder that you can work on and, if the experiment doesn&amp;rsquo;t work, you may discard that branch and everything goes back to normal.</description>

        <guid>https://craftingdh.netlify.com/docs/5-commonregs/</guid>
        <description>The following are the University regulations common to all History courses. COPIES OF WRITTEN WORK SUBMITTED Always retain for yourself a copy of all essays, term papers, written assignments or take-home tests submitted in your courses.
PLAGIARISM The University Senate defines plagiarism as “presenting, whether intentionally or not, the ideas, expression of ideas or work of others as one’s own.” This can include:
 reproducing or paraphrasing portions of someone else’s published or unpublished material, regardless of the source, and presenting these as one’s own without proper citation or reference to the original source; submitting a take home examination, essay, laboratory report or other assignment written, in whole or in part, by someone else; using ideas or direct, verbatim quotations, or paraphrased material, concepts, or ideas without appropriate acknowledgment in any academic assignment; using another’s data or research findings; failing to acknowledge sources through the use of proper citations when using another’s works and/or failing to use quotation marks; handing in &amp;ldquo;substantially the same piece of work for academic credit more than once without prior written permission of the course instructor in which the submission occurs.</description>

        <description>This course originally was a face-to-face class, over 13 weeks. That let us get into the nitty-gritty of different approaches and platforms; it gave us the opportunity to have guest speakers; and most importantly, it gave us the time to really grapple with different kinds of historical &amp;lsquo;capta&amp;rsquo; (see Drucker on &amp;lsquo;capta versus data&amp;rsquo;). But, needs evolved and eventually the course moved fully online. Now only 6 weeks long, a lot of things have been cut, compressed, or rethought entirely.</description>

        <description>Sometimes, a website will have what is called an Application Programming Interface or API. In essence, this lets a program on your computer talk to the computer serving the website you&amp;rsquo;re interested in, such that the website gives you the data that you&amp;rsquo;re looking for.
An API is just a way of opening up a program so that another program can interact with it. That is, instead of an interface meant for a human to interact with the machine, there’s an API to allow some other machine to interact with this one.</description>

        <description>Introduction A jupyter notebook is a way of working with code (in a variety of programming languages) in discrete cells, alongside text, images, figures, videos, and links (written using markdown). Sometimes this is called &amp;lsquo;literate programming&amp;rsquo; because it allows you to weave your narrative about the work, the transformations you&amp;rsquo;re making, the analysis you&amp;rsquo;re doing, around the code itself. In this way, a reader progressing from start to bottom can both replicate your work and reproduce it in other contexts.</description>

        <description>Object Character Recognition is a technique that looks at the pattern of light and dark pixels in an image and matches them against the alphabet. The technique was developed against clean type-written pages where the letters were crisply made. On historical documents, things can get pretty hit-and-miss. When we searched the Chronicling America website, we were actually searching the OCR&amp;rsquo;d text that was embedded in each of those pdfs (if you can select text in a pdf, it has a hidden text layer on top of the image.</description>

        <description>The Google ecosystem has a wide variety of tools that can be made to work in concert. One thing that can be done is to use a Google sheet as the data source for a Google map. If you have data on your own machine in a spreadsheet file or a csv file, you can upload your data to Google Sheets and then plumb that data through the maps. Boom! A very useful process.</description>

        <description>Digital history isn&amp;rsquo;t just about computational analysis or mapwork or computer vision or AI (though of course, it can encompass those things.) It can also create compelling stories and experiences. Sometimes, these can involve very complex websites and underlying js code and so on.
But sometimes, it can be achieved much more simply.
Before video games went all-in on powerful graphics, games (and playful engagements) could create deep simulations and immersive worlds simply through text.</description>

        <description>Zotero is a piece of software for managing your research. When it is installed, it can extract metadata from websites or pdfs (when these have metadata) and store the information in your very own library. Zotero can be connected to Word or Google Docs so that when it is time to insert a reference, you can select the reference from your library - and then get the machine to automatically format/update your bibliography against whatever citation style you use.</description>

Network analysis is all about looking at the patterns of relationships we find in our data, and seeing how individual &amp;lsquo;nodes&amp;rsquo; are positioned vis-a-vis all the other ones, or what the emergent, macroscopic patterns might imply about how the entire population of &amp;hellip;whatever it is you&amp;rsquo;re studying&amp;hellip; might experience things like group identity or flows of information.</description>

        <description>Recall that the index of the collected letters of the Republic of Texas was just a list of letters from so-and-so to so-and-so. We haven&amp;rsquo;t looked at the content of those letters, but the shape of network — the meta data of that correspondence — can be revealing (remember Paul Revere!) When we stitch that together into a network of people connected because they exchanged letters, we end up with a shard of their social network.</description>

It was scanned and OCR&amp;rsquo;d by Google, and is now available as a text file from the Internet Archive. You can see the OCR&amp;rsquo;d text at archive.org.

        <description>Introduction A regular expression (also called regex) is a powerful tool for finding and manipulating text. At its simplest, a regular expression is just a way of looking through texts to locate patterns. When you search a website for instance (use ctrl+f in most applications to search, by the way), the search box finds exact matches; there&amp;rsquo;s no room for fuzziness. A regular expression on the other hand can help you find every line that begins with a number, or every instance of an email address, or whenever a word is used even if there are slight variations in how it&amp;rsquo;s spelled.</description>

        <description>Image Analysis In recent years, historians have started to deal with photographs or videos / video stills as historical documents. Arnold and Tilton call this &amp;lsquo;distant viewing&amp;rsquo;. There are a variety of ways this might pan out; one might identify and analyze colour and composition of key frames in a recording of a historical event. One might track objects or people. In a recent piece of my own, we asked the computer to identify objects and contexts to describe &amp;lsquo;scenes&amp;rsquo; in images pulled from Instagram, in order to explore how people constructed their own &amp;lsquo;cabinets of curiosities&amp;rsquo; (which you can read here, connected to the trade in human remains.</description>

R is a powerful language for statistical exploring, visualizing, and manipulating all kinds of data, including textual. While R can be worked with from the command line, RStudio is what we need to preserve our sanity.</description>

An Introduction to Voyant   &amp;ldquo;The gateway drug to the digital humanities.&amp;rdquo; That&amp;rsquo;s quite a statement - but it&amp;rsquo;s true! What makes Voyant Tools so compelling, in my view, is that it encourages us to play. To take a step back, and turn the knobs and dials and to see what happens next. Voyant encourages us to zoom in and out, looking at the very broad macroscopic and then jump into the micro, and back again.</description>

He writes, &amp;lsquo;the map suggests an argument about the strategies of the rebels and the tactics of counterinsurgency, about the importance of the landscape to the course of the uprising, and about the difficulty of representing such events cartographically with available sources.&amp;rsquo; Spend a few minutes allowing the map to play (link here) and think about the aesthetic and design choices used to communicate this powerful story.</description>

Fair enough. I first encountered podcasting back in about 2005 - ipod, hence podcasting - as part of my previous life in the edtech world. It was difficult to do, and most &amp;lsquo;shows&amp;rsquo; weren&amp;rsquo;t terribly good. I never really got into it, as a producer.

The Storymapjs platform from the Knight Lab at Northwestern University was developed to make this easier to accomplish. Below is an example the Knight Lab put together concerning Arya Stark&amp;rsquo;s journeys. Note how each point in the map can be annotated with videos, images, or other kinds of rich content. Each point on the map is annotated with text and media; the &amp;lsquo;next arrow&amp;rsquo; moves us to the next point, implying a historical or temporal connection.</description>
