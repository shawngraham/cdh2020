- I'm professor Graham. I've been trapped in my basement for a year. So I'm just going to lay things out for you; we've only got six weeks, which isn't a lot of time.

- it's 'crafting' digital history
	- crafting implies error & iteration & personal reflection
	- crafting implies a community of support
	- get comfortable with the idea of things not working

- digital history is bricolage, putting lots of different things together to ask and answer historical questions, and to communicate the results.

- you do not have to be techy. You just have to be honest and open and willing to ask for help.

- digital history is about being able to ask what happens to the _practice_ of history when we have different _kinds_ of materials to work with, and/or different _scales_. Digital history can be about analysis & statistics. It can be about mapping and perspectives. It can be about storytelling and co-creation of knowledge. It can shift authority. It can give voice to the voiceless. It can be used for good or evil. It requires reflection & self-awareness and a willingness to share and be wrong.

- digital history is a team sport. I really ought to explicitly forbid you from trying to power through everything in splendid isolation as a heroic lone scholar. If you tell me that you wrestled with something for three hours, I won't be impressed, I'll ask, 'why didn't you ask for help?'. You are allowed to ask for help from me, from class mates, from friends, from family, from randos on the internet. Just acknowledge who has helped you, on what, and how, and what you've learned.


- notice not using brightspace. 'crafting' is not a one-size-fits all. I'm also not interested in measuring your every point of contact with course materials: you are adults.
- expectations
	- each course part you'll create a repository, hence 4 repos
	- into each repo you'll put the various things you end up making, including screenshots of error messages, intermediary files, the whole lot
	- i require a log.md file that is your 'lab notebook'. Gold standard: you could reproduce what you were doing, pick up where you left off _and someone else could too_
	- I require a reflection.md file that explicitly ties what you've done into the readings, your reactions to my comments & feedback, your interactions with your peers. With citations when appropriate.
	- you can't speedrun the course: explicit reaction to my feedback is a key component. just doing the mere technical stuff is not enough for successful completion.
- the technical stuff involves a lot of choice; i've made a rough division into 'newcomer stream', 'standard stream', 'going further' stream. You can switch streams. Work that merits A+ will show evidence of having pushed yourself beyond where you began, beyond what you thought possible

- there is an exit ticket option at the end of the course where you can reflect on your entire progression and make the argument for how you've grown; the exit ticket can be used to override your other work if you want

- alright? so make sure you read through the syllabus stuff. See this on the right? this is the hypothes.is annotation layer. It's a research tool for collaborative reading. You can use hypothesis to annotate anything you come across on the web, including this website. Join our reading group if you want to use it.

- and one last thing. Learning is a social process. That's why there is a Discord set up for this course. You'll get the invite link in your carleton email. Join up. You'll get more out of this experience the more you engage with your peers. Ask for help. Share screenshots. Collaborate on things. Shoot the breeze. Share neat websites. For the love of god, talk to each other. 

- ok. go read the syllabus, go explore the different tutorials, start part 1 right away. Stuff is due sooner than you think. Stay on top of things. If you're joining the class after the official start date, contact me right away so we can get you up and running.

- try to have fun, eh?
