- You've made it to part three! Cleaning data and wrangling data take up 80% of our time, in digital history. The glamorous stuff, the flashy visualizations, the novel analysis, the compelling storytelling, the macroscopic perspectives on an entire historical corpus - this is the stuff people think of as 'digital history'.

- Like the proverbial iceberg, this is just the part of digital history that everyone can see above the water.

- The readings for this week give you some context for how historians have used visualization and analyses to make compelling _historical_ arguments. The white paper from the RRCNM is very important, because not only does it discuss the kinds of arguments one might construct and their implications, it gives us concrete examples of this kind of work in action. When you're new to digital history, it's easy to get overwhelmed; this white paper can help orient you.

- Similarly, the work by Hitchcock and Moravec shows you two powerful examples of digital history in action as reflection on how we do things in history more generally.

- Finally, the Digital Humanities Awards shows you popular digital humanities projects from around the world, that will give you further inspiration.

- This part of the course will be challenging for you; you are welcome switch Sequences OR, select items from other sequences. Say you've been following the newcomer sequence, but you spot something in the standard sequence that you really want to try as part of your three tutorials. Can you do that? Certainly. Can you do more than the minimum? Absolutely.

- You will get stumped or run into problems. You should not feel embarrassed if you do. I once spent two weeks utterly flummoxed by something that later transpired to be a misplaced comma in a file. It was solved NOT by me asking for help, but by me saying, "I give up; here's my file if someone else wants it, because I. Am. Done." 5 minutes later somebody said 'I took a look; you've got an extra comma in line 541'.

- "many eyes makes for better code". Sometimes, you just need someone else to look at it; sometimes you can achieve the same effect by closing the computer and coming back later. (This is why it's important to keep a log of what you're doing, eh?).

- If it doesn't come in thirty minutes, it won't come in three hours. Make life easy on yourself. Accept that things are going to go sideways: THAT IS THE ENTIRE POINT. That is how we learn. Remember, it's not about how many tutorials you complete. It's about documenting your process, and tying what you do to what you've read/thought/experienced.

- It's entirely OK to try three or four or five exercises and to say, "hey, I only really had success with these two; the third one I got stuck on why the data wasn't in the proper format, but when I went back to look at the source data, I saw that there's something wrong with the formatting. I haven't figured out how to fix that part yet, but my friend Steve is helping me."

- OK? Believe it or not, this stuff can be fun, and please know that I have no expectation or requirement that your tech work is 'perfect' the first time through. Indeed, it may be that in the tutorials I make unwarranted assumptions and perhaps leave out something crucial. The only way that I can realize that is if you tell me. Right? We're collaborating here, and I depend on you to let me know when things aren't working. This course is not about hidden 'gotchas' or trying to trip you up. If there's something that doesn't make sense, it's because I haven't connected the dots well enough. That's on me; but I need you to let me know.

- Finally, it might very well be that you want more materials, or a greater challenge. If that's the case, I invite you to _write_ your own tutorial, and use that as part of your work. Push yourself; address something that we haven't touched on.
